(2006)identified a homozygous A-to-G transition in intron 3 of the\u00a0ACADSB\u00a0gene, resulting in the skipping of exon 3 as confirmed by mRNA analysis. The resultant mRNA likely leads to nonsense-mediated decay, but any residual protein was predicted to lack vital enzyme activity.\u00a0Madsen et al.
