(2003) identified a heterozygous 2397G-A transition in exon 10 of the CACNA1H gene, resulting in a gly773-to-asp (G773D) substitution in the linker region between domains I and II. In these same 2 patients and a third unrelated patient, Vitko et al. (2005) found that all 3 had the G773D variant on the same allele as a common arg788-to-cys (R788C) polymorphism. In vitro functional expression studies by Vitko et al. (2005) demonstrated that both the G773D and the R788C variants independently altered the voltage dependence of channel activation, and together resulted in an even stronger propensity for enhanced neuronal firing. Vitko et al. (2005) noted that the findings supported the idea that variants in the CACNA1H gene are susceptibility alleles that contribute to the development of polygenic disorders such as idiopathic generalized epilepsy. \r\n","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":123,"end":152},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":160,"end":167},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":174,"end":186},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":189,"end":269},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":542,"end":547},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":556,"end":570},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":585,"end":592},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":597,"end":637},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":672,"end":680},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":681,"end":720},"obj":"CPA"}]}
