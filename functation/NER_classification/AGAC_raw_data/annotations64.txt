(2011)\u00a0identified a complex rearrangement that resulted in the patient having a single AKR1C1 (600449)/AKR1C2\u00a0hybrid on allele 1, and paternal AKR1C1, an AKR1C1/AKR1C2\u00a0hybrid, and maternal\u00a0AKR1C2\u00a0genes on allele 2. The intact maternal\u00a0AKR1C2\u00a0gene on allele 2 carried a 666T-G transversion in exon 9, resulting in a his222-to-gln (H222Q) substitution. The mutation was not found in 200 controls, and functional analysis demonstrated markedly reduced activity compared to wildtype.","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":318,"end":324},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":352,"end":381},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":383,"end":395},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":398,"end":432},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":438,"end":446},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":524,"end":531},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":532,"end":540},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"}]}
