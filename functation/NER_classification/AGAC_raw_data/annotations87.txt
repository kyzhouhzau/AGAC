(2001)\u00a0identified an acceptor splice site mutation in the\u00a0OPA3\u00a0gene, IVS1-1G-C, as the cause of 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type III (258501), or optic atrophy plus syndrome, in several Iraqi Jewish patients. The mutation abolished mRNA expression in the patients' fibroblasts. The mutation was also detected in 8 of 85 healthy ethnically matched controls, yielding a carrier frequency of 1 in 10 and indicating a founder effect.","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":37,"end":66},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":74,"end":78},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":85,"end":94},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":229,"end":237},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":238,"end":247},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":248,"end":263},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R3","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"}]}
