(2014)\u00a0identified a homozygous c.1018C-T transition in exon 10 of the\u00a0NADK2\u00a0gene, resulting in an arg340-to-ter (R340X) substitution. The mutation, which was found by exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing, segregated with the disorder in the family and was not present in the dbSNP (build 135), 1000 Genomes Project, or Exome Variant Server databases. Analysis of patient cells indicated that the mutation causes nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, consistent with a severe loss of protein level and function. Wildtype\u00a0NADK2\u00a0was able to rescue deficient DECR activity in patient fibroblasts.","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":111,"end":153},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":161,"end":166},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":173,"end":185},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":189,"end":223},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":502,"end":510},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":511,"end":517},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":518,"end":546},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":573,"end":577},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":581,"end":588},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":589,"end":607},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T8"}]}
