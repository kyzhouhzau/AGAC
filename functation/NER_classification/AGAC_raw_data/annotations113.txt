(2015)identified compound heterozygous mutations in the\u00a0HIBCH\u00a0gene: a single-basepair insertion (c.129dupA), and a c.1033G-A transition (610690.0007). The c.129dupA frameshift mutation introduces a stop codon 8 amino acids downstream. The missense c.1033G-A mutation predicts a gly345 to ser (G345S) change affecting the substrate binding pocket and was predicted to be damaging, with a Polyphen2 score of 0.997.","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":141,"end":150},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":158,"end":163},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":172,"end":197},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":217,"end":237},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":257,"end":286},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":287,"end":297},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":300,"end":335},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":341,"end":368},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":369,"end":377},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":380,"end":408},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":423,"end":447},"obj":"Interaction"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":472,"end":480},"obj":"NegReg"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T13"}]}
