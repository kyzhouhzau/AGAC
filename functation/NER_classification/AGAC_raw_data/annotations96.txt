(1990)\u00a0identified a 7-bp duplication (GCGCACA) in exon 2 of the CYP17A1 gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature stop codon N-terminal to the heme-binding sequence. The patient was genotypically male (46,XY), but phenotypically female. The mutation led to the absence of a functional protein in the adrenal cortex and testis. This lack of protein led to an absence of sex steroids, resulting in female external genitalia, and excessive secretion of steroids with mineralocorticoid activity, resulting in hypertension","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":155,"end":191},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":199,"end":206},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":213,"end":225},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":228,"end":238},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":243,"end":303},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":380,"end":388},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":400,"end":407},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":413,"end":431},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":471,"end":475},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":479,"end":486},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":497,"end":504},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":508,"end":520},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":566,"end":575},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":576,"end":629},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R14","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R15","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T9"}]}
