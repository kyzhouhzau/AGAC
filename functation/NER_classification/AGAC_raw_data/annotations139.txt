(2003) identified a C-T mutation in the PSEN1 gene, resulting in a leu271-to-val (L271V) substitution and deletion of exon 8. Mean age of disease onset was 49 years, and although no affected family members had spastic paraparesis, all developed myoclonus late in the illness. Neuropathologic examination of 2 patients revealed a large number of neocortical large spherical plaques without defined cores or neuritic dystrophy, reminiscent of cotton wool plaques. Biochemical analysis of the mutated protein showed that it resulted in increased secretion of the amyloid-beta-42 peptide.","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":112,"end":124},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":132,"end":137},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":144,"end":156},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":159,"end":193},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":198,"end":216},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":582,"end":589},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":590,"end":597},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":625,"end":634},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":635,"end":675},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T9"}]}
