(2015)\u00a0identified a homozygous G-to-T transversion (c.151+1G-T, NM_005866.3) affecting a splice site in the\u00a0SIGMAR1\u00a0gene, resulting in an in-frame deletion of 20 amino acids in exon 1 (c.92_151del, p.31_50del) in the putative extracellular loop. The mutation, which was found by a combination of homozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing, segregated with the disorder in the family and was not found in 500 Chinese controls. In vitro functional expression assays in HEK293 cells showed that the mutation resulted in lower levels of the protein due to increased proteasomal degradation through the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. The mutant cell lines showed increased ER stress and apoptosis compared to wildtype.","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":180,"end":249},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":257,"end":264},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":271,"end":283},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":287,"end":393},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":685,"end":693},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":706,"end":711},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":712,"end":718},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":726,"end":733},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":741,"end":750},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":751,"end":774},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":787,"end":827},"obj":"Pathway"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":833,"end":839},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":858,"end":867},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":868,"end":877},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":882,"end":891},"obj":"CPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R11","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T15","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R12","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R13","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R3","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R9","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"}]}
