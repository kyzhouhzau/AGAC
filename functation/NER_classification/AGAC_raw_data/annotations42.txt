(2004)\u00a0reported a heterozygous SF1 gene mutation, a C-to-A transversion in exon 2 that replaced cys16 with a stop codon (C16X). The patient showed low basal levels of anti-mullerian hormone (600957) and testosterone (T), weak T response to chorionic gonadotropin (see\u00a0118860), and hypoplastic testes with abundant seminiferous tubules but rare germ cells. This mutation caused premature termination of translation and should abolish all SF1 activity; therefore, haploinsufficiency could explain the deleterious effect of this mutation, suggesting that testis development is more SF1 dose-dependent than adrenal development. The authors concluded that heterozygous mutation can impair adrenal development only if the 2 mechanisms, gene dosage and dominant-negative effects, occur.","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":137,"end":140},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":146,"end":154},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":158,"end":177},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":193,"end":201},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":467,"end":475},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":476,"end":482},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":483,"end":519},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":531,"end":538},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":543,"end":546},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":547,"end":555},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"}]}
