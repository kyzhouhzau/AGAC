(2010)\u00a0identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the\u00a0AUH\u00a0gene: a 559G-A transition, resulting in a gly187-to-ser (G187S) substitution, and a 650G-A transition, resulting in a gly217-to-asp (G217D) substitution. Both mutations were predicted to abolish enzymatic activity by altering trimer formation and catalytic activity, and enzyme activity was virtually undetectable in fibroblasts and lymphocytes. The patient first developed progressive visual loss with optic atrophy at age 35, and developed dysarthria, limb ataxia, and gait ataxia over the following 16 years. Brain MRI at age 61 years showed extensive confluent white matter abnormalities in the supratentorial region with involvement of the deep and subcortical white matter, but sparing of the cerebellum and corpus callosum.","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":138,"end":147},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":155,"end":158},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":167,"end":184},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":186,"end":198},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":201,"end":235},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":243,"end":260},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":262,"end":274},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":277,"end":311},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":318,"end":327},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":346,"end":353},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":354,"end":363},"obj":"Enzyme"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":364,"end":372},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":376,"end":384},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":385,"end":401},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":406,"end":424},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":430,"end":436},"obj":"Enzyme"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":437,"end":445},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":460,"end":472},"obj":"NegReg"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R10","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R12","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R13","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"T17"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"T18"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"}]}
