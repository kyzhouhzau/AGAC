(2013)\u00a0identified heterozygosity for a de novo 1-bp insertion (c.1906_1907insC) in exon 14 of the\u00a0PIK3R1\u00a0gene, causing a frameshift predicted to generate a premature termination codon (Asn636ThrfsTer18). The mutation was not found in her unaffected parents. Functional analysis of patient lymphoblastoid cells showed decreased phosphorylation of the downstream S6 target of the PI3K-AKT (see\u00a0164730)-mTOR (601231) pathway.","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":112,"end":155},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":163,"end":169},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":176,"end":183},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":186,"end":196},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":221,"end":248},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":382,"end":391},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":392,"end":435},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":443,"end":486},"obj":"Pathway"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T6"}]}
