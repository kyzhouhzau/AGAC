(1997)\u00a0described a patient who was a compound heterozygote for a C29R mutation (612779.0004) and an arg886-to-his (R886H) substitution. By assaying recombinant C29R mutant enzyme, they found that C29R had no detectable\u00a0DPYD\u00a0activity; however, R886H showed activity about 40% of normal. The authors concluded that the C29R mutation alone was sufficient to explain the DPD-deficient phenotype and that the R886H mutation was probably a rare polymorphism","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":174,"end":178},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":179,"end":185},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":186,"end":192},"obj":"Enzyme"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":210,"end":214},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":219,"end":221},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":233,"end":237},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":238,"end":246},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":257,"end":262},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":270,"end":278},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":285,"end":298},"obj":"NegReg"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T11"}]}
