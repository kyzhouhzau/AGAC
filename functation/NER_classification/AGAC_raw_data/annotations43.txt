(2009)\u00a0reported a girl of Roma origin who presented at 12.5 years with short stature and a 46,XX karyotype. She was diagnosed with ovarian failure (POF7;\u00a0612964). Analysis of the\u00a0NR5A1\u00a0gene revealed a heterozygous in-frame 9-bp deletion (691_699delCTGCAGCTG) that results in the loss of 3 amino acids (leu231_leu233) in the N-terminal region of the ligand-binding domain. In silico analysis predicted a change in hydrophobicity of helix 1 of the ligand-binding domain. Functional studies indicated that the mutation substantially impaired\u00a0NR5A1\u00a0transactivational activity. The deletion was not observed in 800 control alleles, including samples from 69 unaffected subjects of Roma origin and 56 unaffected subjects from an Indian Gujarati population.","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":195,"end":200},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":230,"end":252},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":280,"end":290},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":295,"end":386},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":523,"end":531},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":546,"end":554},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":555,"end":560},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":561,"end":587},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"}]}
