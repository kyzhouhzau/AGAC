See also\u00a0TPMT*3B (A154T;\u00a0187680.0004) andTPMT*3C (Y240C;\u00a0187680.0005).\r\nIn 4 individuals with decreased\u00a0TPMT\u00a0activity (610460),\u00a0Szumlanski et al. (1996)\u00a0identified homozygosity for 2 mutations in the\u00a0TPMT\u00a0gene: a 460G-A transition in exon 7 resulting in an ala154-to-thr (A154T) substitution, and a 719A-G transition in exon 10 resulting in a tyr240-to-cys (Y240C) substitution. Three liver samples from individuals with intermediate\u00a0TPMT\u00a0activity were heterozygous for the 2 mutations. In vitro functional expression studies showed that each mutation independently, as well as both together, resulted in decreased expression of\u00a0TPMT\u00a0enzymatic activity and immunoreactive protein.","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":247,"end":256},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":264,"end":268},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":277,"end":304},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":305,"end":317},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":321,"end":355},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":363,"end":391},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":392,"end":404},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":407,"end":441},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":607,"end":615},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":669,"end":678},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":679,"end":689},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":693,"end":697},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":698,"end":716},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":721,"end":743},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T19","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R12","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"T17"},{"id":"R13","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"T19"},{"id":"R14","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T18","obj":"T19"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R8","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T15"}]}
