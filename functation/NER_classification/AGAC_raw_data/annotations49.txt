(1999)\u00a0with mild mental retardation distinguished particularly by the presence of chorioathetosis (MRXS10;\u00a0300220),\u00a0Lenski et al. (2007)\u00a0detected a C-to-A transversion in exon 5 of the HADH2 gene, 574C-A, that resulted in a silent amino acid substitution (arg192 to arg, R192R). The mutation resulted in anomalous splicing with loss of exon 5 and a premature stop codon in exon 6. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the mutation resulted in 60 to 70% reduced HADH2 protein in the proband.\u00a0Lenski et al. (2007)\u00a0concluded that reduced expression of the wildtype fragment, which resulted in decreased protein expression, rather than the increased amount of aberrant splicing fragments of the HADH2 gene, was pathogenic","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":218,"end":230},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":248,"end":253},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":273,"end":284},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":305,"end":317},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":346,"end":354},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":355,"end":366},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":367,"end":385},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":391,"end":395},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":412,"end":432},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":488,"end":496},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":519,"end":526},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":527,"end":532},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":533,"end":540},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":593,"end":600},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":601,"end":611},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":656,"end":665},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":666,"end":673},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":674,"end":684},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":702,"end":711},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":757,"end":762},"obj":"Gene"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R11","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R12","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T27","obj":"T23"},{"id":"R13","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T25","obj":"T24"},{"id":"R14","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R15","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R16","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"T19"},{"id":"R17","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"T17"},{"id":"R18","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T20","obj":"T21"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T22","obj":"T23"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T22","obj":"T24"}]}
