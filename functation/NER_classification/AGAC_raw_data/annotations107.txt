(2007)\u00a0identified a homozygous 294A-G transition in the third nucleotide of the last codon of\u00a0GLRX5\u00a0exon 1. The mutation does not change the encoded glutamine at position 98, but is predicted to interfere with the correct RNA splicing. Patient cells showed decreased\u00a0GLRX5\u00a0expression compared to controls, consistent with a splicing defect. Further analysis indicated dysregulation of iron-binding proteins.","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":122,"end":181},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":185,"end":190},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":203,"end":211},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":286,"end":295},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":313,"end":325},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":348,"end":357},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":358,"end":363},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":364,"end":374},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":459,"end":472},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":476,"end":488},"obj":"Interaction"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":489,"end":497},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T8"}]}
