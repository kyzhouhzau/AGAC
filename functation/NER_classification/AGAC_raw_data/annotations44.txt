(1991),\u00a0Krynetski et al. (1995)\u00a0identified a 238G-C transversion in the\u00a0TPMT\u00a0gene, resulting in an ala80-to-pro (A80P) substitution. The patient developed severe hematologic toxicity after conventional therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia with oral mercaptopurine. Functional expression studies in a yeast heterologous expression system showed that the A80P mutant enzyme had a 100-fold reduction in\u00a0TPMT\u00a0catalytic activity compared to the wildtype enzyme, despite a comparable level of mRNA expression. A mutation-specific PCR amplification method was developed and used to detect the same mutation in genomic DNA of the proposita and her mother.\u00a0Krynetski et al. (1995)\u00a0concluded that the patient had a second inactivating mutation.","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":234,"end":253},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":261,"end":265},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":272,"end":284},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":288,"end":320},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":546,"end":557},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":558,"end":564},"obj":"Enzyme"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":580,"end":589},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":593,"end":597},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":598,"end":616},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":905,"end":917},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":918,"end":926},"obj":"Var"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R12","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T9"}]}
