(2008)\u00a0identified a homozygous 1052T-C transition in the\u00a0RBM28\u00a0gene, resulting in a leu351-to-pro (L351P) substitution within the C-terminal region of the RRM3 domain. The mutation was not identified in 1,200 control chromosomes and was predicted to alter the first alpha helix of the RRM3 domain. Normal levels of mutant mRNA were detected, but immunoblotting showed barely detectable levels of\u00a0RBM28\u00a0protein in patient fibroblasts and skin, suggesting protein destabilization and degradation. Transmission electron microscopy of cultured patient fibroblasts showed dilated cisterns of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and decreased number of free ribosomes.","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":187,"end":205},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":213,"end":218},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":225,"end":237},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":240,"end":322},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":328,"end":336},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":406,"end":411},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":416,"end":452},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":471,"end":482},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":524,"end":530},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":542,"end":548},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":552,"end":557},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":558,"end":565},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":610,"end":617},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":618,"end":633},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":638,"end":649},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":779,"end":788},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":789,"end":813},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R12","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R13","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R14","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"T16"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T10"}]}
