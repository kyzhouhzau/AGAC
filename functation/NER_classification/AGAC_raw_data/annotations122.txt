(2013)\u00a0identified heterozygosity for a 969C-A transversion in the\u00a0OPLAH\u00a0gene, resulting in a ser323-to-arg (S323R) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the first domain, near an ATP-binding site. The presence of a large deletion or duplication was excluded by gel electrophoresis. The patient's asymptomatic mother was also heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found in her father or in 128 controls.","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":233,"end":252},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":260,"end":265},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":272,"end":284},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":287,"end":397},"obj":"Var"}]}
