(2015)identified heterozygosity for a c.2266A-G transition (c.2266A-G, NM_001105078) in the\u00a0MECOM\u00a0gene, resulting in a thr756-to-ala (T756A) substitution at a highly conserved residue within the eighth zinc finger motif in the C-terminal zinc finger domain. The mutation was not present in her unaffected parents or healthy brother, in 382 ethnically matched controls, or in the dbSNP, 1000 Genomes Project, Human Genetic Variation, or ExAC databases. Luciferase assays using pAP1 (165160)-luc in transfected NIH3T3 and HEK293 cells demonstrated enhanced suppression of relative luciferase activity with the T756A mutant compared to wildtype EVI1, whereas luciferase assays using a p3TP-lux vector showed an attenuated response with the mutant.\u00a0Niihori et al. (2015)\u00a0suggested that the T756A mutant might represent a gain-of-function effect for AP1 and partial loss of function for TGF-beta (190180) signaling.","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":174,"end":194},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":228,"end":233},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":240,"end":252},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":255,"end":392},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":682,"end":690},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":691,"end":702},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":706,"end":725},"obj":"Enzyme"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":726,"end":734},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":744,"end":756},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":922,"end":934},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":953,"end":969},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":981,"end":984},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":997,"end":1013},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1018,"end":1045},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R12","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R8","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R9","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T13"}]}
