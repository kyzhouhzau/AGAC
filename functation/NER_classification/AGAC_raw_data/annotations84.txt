Although the mutant protein retained the ability to bind the partner protein GATA4 (600576) and repress GATA4-mediated gene activation, it was subtly impaired in this function.","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":99,"end":117},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":125,"end":130},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":137,"end":149},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":152,"end":182},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":197,"end":203},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":204,"end":211},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":334,"end":342},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":351,"end":359},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"}]}
