(2006) found that the frequency of the IL1B -31TT genotype was 0.071 compared to 0.37 as reported in Caucasians. Among the Indian population, they observed a significantly higher frequency of the IL1B -511TT genotype (OR of 4.22) and -31CC genotype (OR of 2.16) in H. pylori-infected persons with duodenal ulcer compared to infected persons with normal mucosa. The -511T/-31C haplotype was present at a higher frequency in H. pylori-infected duodenal ulcer patients than in infected controls (OR of 2.47). Carriers of the -31CC genotype had significantly lower IL1B mRNA levels in gastric mucosa compared to other genotypes, and IL1B promoter assay showed that the -31T promoter had a 10-fold increase in activity compared to -31C. Chakravorty et al. (2006) suggested that H. pylori-infected individuals with the -31CC genotype secrete less IL1B and are susceptible to duodenal ulcers. \r\n","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":616,"end":621},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":622,"end":626},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":627,"end":638},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":754,"end":762},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":766,"end":774},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"}]}
