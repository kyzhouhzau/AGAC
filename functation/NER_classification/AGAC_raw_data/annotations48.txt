(2009)\u00a0identified the R130C substitution in a patient with HSD10 deficiency reported by\u00a0Sutton et al. (2003). The patient had a severe phenotype with seizures and visual loss, and died at age 10 years.\u00a0Yang et al. (2009)\u00a0stated that the R130C substitution resulted from a 419C-T transition in exon 4 of the\u00a0HSD17B10\u00a0gene. Fibroblast\u00a0HSD17B10\u00a0protein levels were about 50% of normal controls, but enzyme activity was less than 1.4% of normal values. In vitro functional expression assays showed that the mutant protein had almost no catalytic activity toward allopregnanolone or 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyryl CoA.\u00a0Yang et al. (2009)\u00a0postulated that the neurologic phenotype was due to an imbalance in neurosteroid metabolism.\u00a0Yang (2014)\u00a0corrected the nucleotide transition to 388C-T.","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":255,"end":267},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":268,"end":276},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":291,"end":301},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":319,"end":327},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":345,"end":353},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":354,"end":361},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":408,"end":423},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":428,"end":432},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":515,"end":521},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":522,"end":529},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":541,"end":543},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":544,"end":562},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":660,"end":680},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":685,"end":691},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":695,"end":704},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":708,"end":731},"obj":"Pathway"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R10","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R12","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R13","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T1"}]}
