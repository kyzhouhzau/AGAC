(1996)\u00a0identified a homozygous C-to-T transition in exon 1 of the CYP17A1 gene, resulting in an arg96-to-trp (R96W) substitution. Functional expression studies showed that the mutation almost completely abolished the activity of the mutant protein.\u00a0Laflamme et al. (1996)\u00a0pointed out that 17-alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency impairs steroid biosynthesis in the adrenals and gonads; in contrast to congenital adrenal hyperplasia (201910), caused by 21-alpha-hydroxylase or 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency, in which steroid formation is impaired exclusively in the adrenals","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":200,"end":228},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":246,"end":253},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":260,"end":272},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":276,"end":308},"obj":"Var"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"}]}
