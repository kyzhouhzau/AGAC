(2015)\u00a0identified compound heterozygous mutations in the\u00a0CLPB\u00a0gene: a c.1233G-A transition (c.1233G-A, NM_030813.4) in exon 11, resulting in a met411-to-ile (M411I) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the AAA+ domain, and a c.1850A-G transition in exon 16, resulting in a tyr617-to-cys (Y617C;\u00a0616254.0005) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the D2 domain. Expression of the M411I or Y617C alleles could not rescue morpholino knockdown of the\u00a0clpb\u00a0ortholog in zebrafish, suggesting that these variants have little or no residual activity.","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":218,"end":227},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":235,"end":239},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":248,"end":304},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":306,"end":318},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":321,"end":404},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":412,"end":443},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":445,"end":457},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":460,"end":554},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":692,"end":700},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":706,"end":712},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":716,"end":718},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":719,"end":736},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R8","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T11"}]}
