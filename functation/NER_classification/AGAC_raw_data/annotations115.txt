(2009)\u00a0identified a homozygous 1-bp insertion (1273insA) in exon 3 of the\u00a0OBSL1\u00a0gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. The mutation occurred near the N terminus and affected all\u00a0OBSL1isoforms, consistent with complete loss of protein function and a null phenotype. Two of the families were large consanguineous families with multiple affected individuals. Two additional probands with the disorder were compound heterozygous for the 1273insA mutation and another truncating mutation in the\u00a0OBSL1gene: a 1149C-A transversion in exon 3, resulting in a cys383-to-ter substitution (C383X;\u00a0610991.0002), and a 10-bp deletion in exon 3 (610991.0003), respectively.","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":139,"end":174},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":182,"end":187},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":194,"end":206},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":209,"end":219},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":224,"end":245},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":251,"end":259},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":293,"end":301},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":306,"end":311},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":311,"end":319},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":346,"end":350},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":354,"end":361},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":362,"end":370},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":561,"end":578},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":591,"end":610},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":618,"end":623},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":631,"end":661},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":663,"end":675},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":678,"end":704},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":733,"end":757},"obj":"Var"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R12","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T16","obj":"T17"},{"id":"R13","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T18","obj":"T17"},{"id":"R14","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T19","obj":"T17"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T10"}]}
