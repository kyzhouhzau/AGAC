Mason et al. (1999) identified a C-to-G transversion in the intracellular cytoplasmic tail near the seventh transmembrane-spanning segment of the human ADRB1 gene, resulting in an arg389-to-gly substitution (R389G). Allele frequencies for gly389 and arg389 residues were 0.26 and 0.74, respectively (the former had previously been considered as the human wildtype ADRB1 allele). Using site-directed mutagenesis to mimic the 2 variants, cultured cells were permanently transfected to express the gly389 and arg389 receptors. In functional studies with matched expression, the arg389 receptors had slightly higher basal levels of adenylyl cyclase activities. However, maximal isoproterenol-stimulated levels were markedly higher for the arg389 receptor as compared with the gly389 receptor. Agonist-promoted binding was also increased for the arg389 receptor, consistent with enhanced coupling to stimulatory G protein (Gs; see 139320) and increased adenylyl cyclase activation. These and other studies indicated that this polymorphic variation of the human ADRB1 gene results in alterations of receptor-Gs interaction with functional consequences on signal transduction, consistent with its localization in a putative G-protein binding domain. Mason et al. (1999) suggested that the genetic variation of the ADRB1 gene may be the basis of interindividual differences in pathophysiologic characteristics or in the response to therapeutic beta-adrenergic receptor agonists and antagonists in cardiovascular and other diseases.\r\n","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":217,"end":236},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":336,"end":341},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":348,"end":360},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":364,"end":390},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":743,"end":753},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":789,"end":795},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":812,"end":839},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":904,"end":910},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":990,"end":997},"obj":"Interaction"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1007,"end":1016},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1058,"end":1066},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1079,"end":1100},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1122,"end":1131},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1132,"end":1159},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1217,"end":1226},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1240,"end":1245},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1251,"end":1261},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1277,"end":1300},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1401,"end":1410},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1411,"end":1418},"obj":"Interaction"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1474,"end":1483},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1491,"end":1496},"obj":"Gene"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"T16"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T21","obj":"T22"},{"id":"R12","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T23"},{"id":"R13","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"T24"},{"id":"R14","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T20","obj":"T25"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T19","obj":"T18"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"T19"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T11"}]}
