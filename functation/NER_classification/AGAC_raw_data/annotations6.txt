(2012) identified a de novo heterozygous 984G-C transversion in the ACTA1 gene, resulting in a lys328-to-asn (K328N) substitution (K326N in the mature protein). Patient biopsy showed nemaline bodies and 32% mutant actin. In vitro motility analysis of actin thin filaments derived from the patient's tissue showed increased sensitivity to calcium, indicating an activated state. Expression of the mutant in mouse muscle cells did not result in the formation of rod-like structures, suggesting a different mechanism of nemaline body formation. Medical treatment was ineffective, and the patient died at age 9 months in an asystolic episode. The report expanded the phenotypic spectrum associated with ACTA1 mutations to include stiffness, rigidity, and hypertonicity.","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":166,"end":198},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":206,"end":211},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":218,"end":230},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":233,"end":267},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":282,"end":296},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":352,"end":357},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":451,"end":460},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":461,"end":483},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":499,"end":508},"obj":"PosReg"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T8"}]}
