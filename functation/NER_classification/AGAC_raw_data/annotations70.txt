(2003)identified 2 mutations in the\u00a0GDF5\u00a0gene: a silent 1137A-G transition encoding lysine and a 1-bp deletion, 1144delG, predicting a frameshift resulting in loss of the biologically active C terminus of the protein. The affected sibs were homozygous for the 1144delG mutation and each parent was heterozygous. The affected sibs had normal axial skeletons, severely shortened and deformed limbs with severity increasing in a proximodistal gradient, and subluxated joints. The humeri and femora were hypoplastic with distal malformations. The radii/ulnae were shortened and deformed whereas carpal bones were invariably rudimentary or absent. The tibiae appeared rudimentary; fibulae were absent in 2 children, and some tarsal and metatarsal bones were absent. Only distal phalanges were present. The father and mother had short first metacarpal and middle phalanx of the fifth finger and hallux valgus, respectively.","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":118,"end":127},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":135,"end":139},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":148,"end":189},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":194,"end":219},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":221,"end":231},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":234,"end":244},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":245,"end":254},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":258,"end":262},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":270,"end":300},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":308,"end":315},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R3","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T9"}]}
