(2012)\u00a0identified compound heterozygosity for mutation in the\u00a0DHTKD1\u00a0gene, an A-to-G transition affecting the initiating methionine codon and a nonsense mutation (614984.0002). The 1A-G mutation was predicted to cause out-of-frame usage of the next AUG triplet 160 nucleotides downstream and thus result in a nonfunctional protein. This mutation was also identified in the patient's mother.","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":126,"end":134},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":142,"end":148},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":158,"end":175},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":176,"end":185},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":190,"end":217},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":224,"end":241},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":261,"end":274},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":292,"end":297},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":298,"end":367},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":389,"end":402},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":403,"end":410},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T11"}]}
