The mutation introduced an asn-glu-thr N-linked oligosaccharide attachment sequence centered on asn494, which explained the increase in molecular mass. The mutant albumin was associated with no apparent pathology and was detected in 2 unrelated individuals of Anglo-Saxon descent.","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":50,"end":57},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":58,"end":65},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":82,"end":96},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":107,"end":113},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":225,"end":233},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":345,"end":353},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":357,"end":371},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T9"}]}
