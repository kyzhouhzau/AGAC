(1997)\u00a0sequenced the\u00a0CYP17\u00a0gene from a Japanese patient with combined complete 17-alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency (202110) previously reported by\u00a0Yazaki et al. (1982). The patient was homozygous for a G-to-A transition at position +5 of the 5-prime splice site of intron 7. In vitro expression analysis of an allelic minigene containing exons 6-8 of the mutant gene showed skipping of exon 7. This exon skipping alters the translational reading frame of exon 8 and introduces a premature stop codon at amino acid position 410, proximal to the heme iron-binding site essential for the enzymatic activity ofCYP17. Restriction enzyme analysis showed that the patient was homozygous and the parents were heterozygous for the mutation.","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":424,"end":437},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":438,"end":444},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":449,"end":486},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":491,"end":501},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":504,"end":591},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":610,"end":619},"obj":"Enzyme"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":620,"end":628},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":631,"end":636},"obj":"Gene"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T3"}]}
