(2012)\u00a0identified homozygosity for a 1-bp insertion (2601insC) in the\u00a0OPLAH\u00a0gene, predicted to cause a frameshift and premature termination sequence resulting in almost complete removal of the oxoprolinase domain. His clinically unaffected sister was also homozygous for the mutation, and was subsequently found to have increased 5-oxoproline excretion in the urine. Their first-cousin parents were heterozygous for the mutation, which the authors stated was not listed in any public databases including the 1000 Genomes Project.","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":126,"end":140},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":159,"end":164},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":184,"end":189},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":192,"end":202},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":207,"end":228},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":267,"end":274},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":282,"end":301},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":364,"end":372},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":409,"end":418},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":419,"end":454},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T9"}]}
