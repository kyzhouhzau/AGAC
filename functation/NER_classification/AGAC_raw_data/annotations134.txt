(2015)\u00a0identified compound heterozygous mutations in the\u00a0CLPB\u00a0gene: a c.1222A-G transition (c.1222A-G, NM_030813.4) in exon 11, resulting in an arg408-to-gly (R408G) substitution at a conserved residue in the AAA+ domain, and a c.1249C-T transition in exon 11, resulting in an arg417-to-ter (R417X;\u00a0616254.0007) substitution. The R408G mutation had a frequency of 0.011% (22 of 122,848 alleles) in the Exome Aggregation Consortium database, and the R417X mutation was found in 4 of 122,848 alleles in this database; all controls were heterozygous for the mutations. In vitro functional expression studies indicated that the R408G mutant protein had decreased ATPase activity at 26% of wildtype. Expression of the R408G mutant allele was unable to rescue morpholino knockdown of the\u00a0clpb\u00a0ortholog in zebrafish, suggesting that this variant has decreased residual activity.","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":202,"end":211},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":219,"end":223},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":232,"end":288},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":290,"end":302},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":306,"end":382},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":390,"end":421},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":423,"end":435},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":439,"end":486},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":786,"end":798},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":799,"end":806},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":811,"end":820},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":821,"end":836},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":993,"end":1000},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1005,"end":1014},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1015,"end":1032},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R9","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T15"}]}
