(2004)\u00a0demonstrated a 6-bp deletion that removed the acceptor splice site adjacent to exon 5 of the HADH gene. They demonstrated that exon 5 is skipped during the mRNA splicing process, so that exon 4 is coupled directly onto exon 6. This led to an in-frame deletion of 90 nucleotides in the mature mRNA, resulting in a protein product predicted to lack 30 amino acids. Both parents were heterozygous.","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":201,"end":214},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":220,"end":271},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":279,"end":283},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":428,"end":463},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":528,"end":532},"obj":"NegReg"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R3","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T6"}]}
