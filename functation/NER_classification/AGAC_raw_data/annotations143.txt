(2001) found that the A692G substitution, which they referred to as the 'Flemish variant,' increased the solubility of processed beta-amyloid peptides and increased the stability of peptide oligomers. They concluded that conformational changes in the peptide induced by this mutation would facilitate peptide adherence to the vascular endothelium, creating nidi for amyloid growth. Increased peptide solubility and assembly stability would favor formation of larger amyloid deposits and inhibit their elimination.\r\n","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":67,"end":85},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":136,"end":145},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":150,"end":195},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":200,"end":209},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":214,"end":244},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":266,"end":303},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":304,"end":314},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":320,"end":328},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":335,"end":345},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":346,"end":363},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":371,"end":391},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":393,"end":401},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":402,"end":425},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":427,"end":436},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":437,"end":455},"obj":"MPA"}]}
