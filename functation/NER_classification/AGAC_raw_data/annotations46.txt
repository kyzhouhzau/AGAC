(1998)\u00a0identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the\u00a0TPMT\u00a0gene:\u00a0TPMT*3A (187680.0002) and a new variant allele,TPMT*4A, caused by a G-to-A transition that disrupted the acceptor splice junction at the final 3-prime nucleotide of intron 9. The new allele was found to cosegregate with reduced\u00a0TPMT\u00a0activity within an extended kindred. The mutation was found to lead to generation of at least 2 aberrant mRNA species. The first resulted from use of a novel splice site located 1 nucleotide 3-prime downstream from the original splice junction. This mRNA species contained a single nucleotide deletion and a frameshift in exon 10, the terminal exon of the gene. The second novel mRNA species resulted from activation of a cryptic splice site located within intron 9, leading to inclusion of 330 nucleotides of intron sequence. That sequence contained a premature translation termination codon.\u00a0TPMT*4 was the first reported allele for low\u00a0TPMT\u00a0activity as a result of a mutation within an intron","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":118,"end":148},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":152,"end":165},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":223,"end":232},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":235,"end":252},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":258,"end":267},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":272,"end":296},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":387,"end":394},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":395,"end":399},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":400,"end":408},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":441,"end":449},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":471,"end":481},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":496,"end":517},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":650,"end":654},"obj":"RNA"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":675,"end":701},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":708,"end":718},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":773,"end":791},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":792,"end":805},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":806,"end":836},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":867,"end":877},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":878,"end":925},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1035,"end":1038},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1039,"end":1043},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1044,"end":1052},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1070,"end":1078},"obj":"Var"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R12","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T16"},{"id":"R14","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T20","obj":"T21"},{"id":"R15","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T23","obj":"T19"},{"id":"R16","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T21","obj":"T19"},{"id":"R17","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"T24"},{"id":"R18","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T18","obj":"T24"},{"id":"R19","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T24","obj":"T26"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R20","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T25","obj":"T26"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R8","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T11"}]}
