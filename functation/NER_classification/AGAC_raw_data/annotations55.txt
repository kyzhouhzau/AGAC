(1996)\u00a0characterized the\u00a0DAX1\u00a0gene from 6 patients, including 2 sibs, with AHC (300200), and found 5 novel mutations including 3 nonsense and 2 frameshift mutations. The nonsense mutations were a C-to-T transition (gln395-to-ter; Q395X), a C-to-G transversion (tyr271-to-ter; Y271X;\u00a0300473.0010), and a C-to-A transversion (tyr91-to-ter; Y91X;\u00a0300473.0011). The Y91X mutation was found in 2 sibs. The frameshift mutations were a 2-bp deletion (1610delAT) and a 1-bp (G) insertion resulting in a premature stop at codon 462 (300473.0012), and a 1-bp deletion (1169delC), resulting in a frameshift which caused a premature stop codon at position 371 (300473.0013). A 21-year-old male patient in whom the Q395X mutation was identified had hypogonadotropic hypogonadism; the other 5 patients were prepubertal. All mutated NR0B1 proteins had truncated C-terminal domains, suggesting that these 5 mutations cause AHC and that the C terminus of theDAX1\u00a0protein, especially the terminal 11 amino acids, is necessary for normal adrenal cortical embryogenesis.","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":120,"end":177},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":183,"end":201},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":209,"end":226},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":253,"end":272},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":316,"end":335},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":414,"end":434},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":442,"end":455},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":474,"end":492},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":493,"end":505},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":508,"end":535},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":557,"end":570},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":583,"end":595},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":598,"end":608},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":615,"end":621},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":624,"end":660},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":823,"end":830},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":831,"end":836},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":837,"end":845},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":846,"end":849},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":850,"end":878},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R10","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T15","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"T18"},{"id":"R12","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T18","obj":"T16"},{"id":"R13","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T16","obj":"T19"},{"id":"R14","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T20","obj":"T19"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T14"}]}
