(1996), this mutation was referred to as G2434R by Richter et al. (1997). Functional studies showed that the G2434R mutation enhanced the sensitivity of RYR1 to activating concentrations of calcium and to caffeine. In parallel, the sensitivity to inhibiting concentrations of calcium and calmodulin was reduced, transferring the mutant calcium- release channel into a hyperexcitable state.\r\n","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":232,"end":247},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":248,"end":256},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":261,"end":272},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":276,"end":280},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":284,"end":294},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":295,"end":336},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":355,"end":366},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":370,"end":380},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":381,"end":421},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":426,"end":433},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":452,"end":483},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":491,"end":505},"obj":"PosReg"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R9","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T12"}]}
