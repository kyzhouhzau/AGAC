(2005)identified an identical 2-bp deletion in exon 24 of the\u00a0CUL7, resulting in a val1484-to-gly substitution and a frameshift leading to termination 68 codons downstream (Val1484GlyfsTer68). The presence of the same deletion in multiple consanguineous families suggested a founder effect in this region of North Africa.\u00a0Huber et al. (2005)reported the deletion as 4449_4450delTG, but\u00a0Huber et al. (2009)\u00a0reported it as 4450_4451delTG.
