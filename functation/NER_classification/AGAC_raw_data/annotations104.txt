(2005)\u00a0found that affected individuals had an 4333C-T transition in exon 23 of the\u00a0CUL7\u00a0gene, resulting in conversion of arg1445 to a stop codon in the cullin domain of the protein (R1445X). Additional studies indicated that the mutation renderedCUL7\u00a0deficient in recruiting ROC1 (603814) to the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex of which it is a part. A founder effect appeared clearly to be involved.","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":126,"end":155},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":159,"end":172},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":174,"end":186},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":201,"end":245},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":253,"end":260},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":309,"end":317},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":331,"end":340},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":344,"end":403},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"}]}
