(2006) identified a somatic 1544G-T transversion in the MPL gene, resulting in a trp515-to-leu (W515L) substitution, in 4 (9%) of 45 patients with myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (see 254450). Two of the patients also had leukocytosis and thrombocytosis at the time of disease presentation. Functional expression studies showed that this was an activating mutation conferring cytokine-independent growth and hypersensitivity to TPHO in cell culture. The W515L mutant protein resulted in constitutive phosphorylation of downstream signaling molecules, including JAK2 (147796), STAT3 (102582), and ERK (600997). Expression of W515L in murine bone marrow resulted in a fully penetrant myeloproliferative disorder with thrombocytosis and extramedullary hematopoiesis. \r\n","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":34,"end":62},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":70,"end":73},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":80,"end":92},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":95,"end":129},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":474,"end":486},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":487,"end":494},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":495,"end":506},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":520,"end":569},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":630,"end":640},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":644,"end":649},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":672,"end":683},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":692,"end":729},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":735,"end":749},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":754,"end":782},"obj":"CPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R12","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R13","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R8","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T12"}]}
