(2010)\u00a0identified a homozygous 991A-T transversion, resulting in a lys331-to-ter (K331X) substitution, resulting in the production of an aberrant protein lacking the 8 terminal residues. The terminal part of the protein is necessary for the active-site pocket, for subunit interaction, and trimer stabilization. The patient had a complete deficiency of enzyme activity. He presented at age 30 years with mild cerebellar ataxia, which progressed to spastic paraparesis, nystagmus, and dementia over the next 29 years. Brain MRI at age 50 years showed extensive confluent white matter abnormalities in the supratentorial region with involvement of the deep and subcortical white matter, but sparing of the cerebellum and corpus callosum.","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":153,"end":172},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":174,"end":186},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":189,"end":223},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":225,"end":237},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":268,"end":275},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":276,"end":307},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":461,"end":471},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":475,"end":481},"obj":"Enzyme"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":482,"end":490},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T9"}]}
