(2007) identified compound heterozygous truncating mutations in the IL2RA gene: a 1-bp insertion (c.692ins), resulting in a frameshift and premature termination, and a c.301C-T transition (147730.0005), resulting in a stop codon and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Each mutation was inherited from an unaffected parent. Patient lymphocyte cells showed complete absence of IL2RA expression, consistent with a loss of function. Parental lymphocytes showed about half the amount of CD25 on the cell surface during T-cell activation. Patient T cells showed poor proliferation in response to IL2, but this effect could be rescued by high doses of IL2 or IL15 (600554), indicating that the rest of the downstream signaling pathway was intact. The patient had recurrent infections from infancy, and immunologic studies showed defective IL10 (124092) expression from CD4+ T cells. The findings indicated that IL2 responsiveness is important for IL10 production from CD4+ cells.
