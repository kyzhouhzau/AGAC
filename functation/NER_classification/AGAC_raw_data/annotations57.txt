(2003)\u00a0identified a C-to-A transversion in the second exon of the\u00a0DAX1\u00a0gene that resulted in the change of tyr399 to a premature stop codon (Y399X), which truncates the\u00a0DAX1\u00a0protein by 71 amino acids. Kindred analysis established that the mutation had been inherited from the proband's mother. The proband, his deceased brother, and a maternal cousin were hemizygous for the mutation. The mutation was associated with loss of Leydig cell responsiveness to human chorionic gonadotropin (see\u00a0118860); the 35-year-old proband exhibited hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Immunohistochemical analysis of testicular tissue obtained from the proband's affected sib, who had died from adrenal failure as a neonate, showed normal testicular morphology and expression of\u00a0DAX1, steroidogenic factor-1 (184757), and anti-mullerian hormone (600957). Transient transfection assays demonstrated that the mutation resulted in a severe loss of\u00a0DAX1\u00a0repressor activity","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":136,"end":174},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":182,"end":186},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":197,"end":208},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":213,"end":255},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":271,"end":280},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":285,"end":289},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":290,"end":297},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":505,"end":513},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":534,"end":538},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":542,"end":600},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1002,"end":1010},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1032,"end":1036},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1040,"end":1044},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1045,"end":1063},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R9","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T12"}]}
