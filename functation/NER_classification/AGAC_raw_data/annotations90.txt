(2012)\u00a0identified a homozygous 1-bp deletion (c.300delA) in exon 6 of the\u00a0DNAJC19\u00a0gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination (Ala100fsTer11). The unaffected parents were heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found in a cohort of 22 children with cardiomyopathy. Western blot analysis of patient cells showed no detectable\u00a0DNAJC19\u00a0protein. The brothers had noncompaction cardiomyopathy, which resulted in death in 1 patient at age 13 months.","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":123,"end":158},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":166,"end":173},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":180,"end":192},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":195,"end":205},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":210,"end":231},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":422,"end":424},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":436,"end":443},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":444,"end":451},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T4"}]}
