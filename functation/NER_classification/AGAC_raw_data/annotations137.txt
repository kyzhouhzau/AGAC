(2000) showed that cys92-to-ser (C92S), the PS1 homolog of the C. elegans sel-12 loss of function mutation cys60 to ser, increased amyloid beta-42 production when expressed in a neuroglioma cell line, similar to other pathogenic PS1 mutations. They noted, but did not cite, a report identifying C92S as the pathogenic mutation in an Italian family with familial Alzheimer disease (AD3; 607822). The results suggested that all FAD-linked PS1 mutations result in increased amyloid beta-42 production through a partial loss of function mechanism.","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":76,"end":132},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":134,"end":143},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":144,"end":170},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":242,"end":255},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":439,"end":463},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":474,"end":483},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":484,"end":510},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":529,"end":545},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":546,"end":555},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T6"}]}
