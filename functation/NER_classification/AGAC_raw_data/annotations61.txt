(1994)\u00a0found a thr877-to-ala mutation in the hormone-binding domain of the\u00a0AR\u00a0gene. The same mutation had been reported previously in a metastatic prostatic cancer cell line where it conferred on the androgen receptor an altered ligand-binding specificity that was stimulated by estrogens, progestagens, and antiandrogens.\u00a0Gaddipati et al. (1994)\u00a0suggested that the codon 877 mutant\u00a0AR\u00a0with altered ligand binding may provide a selective growth advantage in the genesis of a subset of advanced prostate cancer. The stimulatory effect of the usual therapeutic agents on the codon 877 mutant\u00a0AR\u00a0may contribute to treatment-refractory disease.","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":156,"end":208},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":216,"end":218},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":234,"end":242},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":324,"end":333},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":362,"end":462},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":507,"end":523},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":524,"end":526},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":532,"end":539},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":540,"end":554},"obj":"Interaction"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":569,"end":585},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":586,"end":595},"obj":"PosReg"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T6"}]}
