(2005)\u00a0detected homozygosity for a C-to-A transversion in exon 1 of the CYP17A1 gene that introduced a stop codon in place of tyrosine at codon 27 (Y27X). The patient's steroid metabolism showed increased levels of mineralocorticoid precursors and low or undetectable plasma concentrations of 17-alpha-hydroxycorticoids, androgens, and estrogens before and after ACTH stimulation. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry urinary steroid profile was dominated by metabolites of corticosterone and its precursors, while cortisol and C19-steroid metabolites were lacking.
