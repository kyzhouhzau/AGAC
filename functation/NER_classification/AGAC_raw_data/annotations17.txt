(1985), Kralovics et al. (1998) identified a heterozygous 5964C-G transversion in exon 8 of the EPOR gene, resulting in a tyr426-to-ter (Y426X) substitution. The resultant mutant protein is truncated by 83 amino acids and lacks 7 C terminal tyrosine residues. The mutant receptor exhibited hypersensitive erythropoietin-dependent proliferation compared to the wildtype EPOR when tested in a murine interleukin-3-dependent myeloid cell line. Kralovics et al. (1998) examined the segregation of the mutation in the family and found that a child in the third generation inherited the mutation but had no laboratory evidence of erythrocytosis. Furthermore, in vitro analysis of the erythroid progenitor cells of this affected child revealed hypersensitivity to erythropoietin, suggesting a defect at the level of progenitor cells. Failure of this child to develop the disorder suggested the existence of as yet unidentified environmental or genetic factors that suppress disease development. \r\n","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":167,"end":187},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":205,"end":209},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":216,"end":228},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":231,"end":265},"obj":"Var"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"}]}
