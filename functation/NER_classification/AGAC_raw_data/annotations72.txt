(2008)identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the\u00a0GDF5\u00a0gene: a 1133G-A transition resulting in an arg378-to-gln (R378Q) substitution inherited from the father, and a 1306C-A transversion resulting in a pro436-to-thr (P436T;\u00a0601146.0019) substitution inherited from the mother. The R378Q substitution is located at the end of the prodomain within the recognition motif at the processing site of\u00a0GDF5\u00a0where the precursor protein is cleaved and was predicted to result in at least partial loss of function. The P436T substitution is located within the mature domain of\u00a0GDF5\u00a0and was predicted to interfere with binding to BMPR1B (603248). The patient's mother was unaffected, whereas the father had very mild radiographic features of brachymesophalangy of the hand digits","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":149,"end":158},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":166,"end":170},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":179,"end":197},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":198,"end":210},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":214,"end":248},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":282,"end":302},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":303,"end":315},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":318,"end":365},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":397,"end":415},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":510,"end":514},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":525,"end":542},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":546,"end":553},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":602,"end":606},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":610,"end":618},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":624,"end":642},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":682,"end":686},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":708,"end":722},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":723,"end":730},"obj":"Interaction"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":734,"end":740},"obj":"Gene"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R12","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T15","obj":"T19"},{"id":"R13","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T18","obj":"T17"},{"id":"R15","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"T19"},{"id":"R3","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R8","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R9","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T13"}]}
