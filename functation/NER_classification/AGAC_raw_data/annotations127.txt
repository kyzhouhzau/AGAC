(2012)\u00a0identified a homozygous 4-bp deletion (1167delTCAG) in a canonical splice site of the\u00a0SERAC1\u00a0gene, resulting in the skipping of exon 12 and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The mutation was not found in 369 controls. The patient, who was originally reported as patient 1 by\u00a0Wortmann et al. (2006), had recurrent infections, failure to thrive, mental retardation, spasticity and extrapyramidal symptoms, deafness, hypoglycemia, increased serum lactate, abnormal lesions on brain imaging, and oxidative phosphorylation defects.","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":120,"end":174},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":182,"end":188},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":195,"end":207},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":212,"end":231},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":236,"end":264},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":520,"end":529},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":530,"end":543},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"}]}
