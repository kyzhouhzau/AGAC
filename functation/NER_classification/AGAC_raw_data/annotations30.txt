(2005) elucidated an unusual mechanism of aberrant pre-mRNA splicing resulting in constitutive activation of the oncoprotein. The deletion of noncoding and coding regions encompassing the 3-prime authentic splice site creates a novel intraexonic pre-mRNA 3-prime splice acceptor site, leading to in-frame loss of 27 nucleotides. Three-dimensional structural analysis revealed that loss of the 9 amino acids in this critical location unleashes the protein from autoinhibition, causing KIT to become constitutively activated and resulting in the GIST phenotype. \r\n","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":195,"end":203},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":204,"end":221},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":235,"end":258},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":266,"end":277},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":283,"end":291},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":449,"end":462},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":637,"end":640},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":651,"end":675},"obj":"PosReg"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R3","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"}]}
