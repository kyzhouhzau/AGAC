(1992), Dib-Hajj et al. (2005) identified a heterozygous 4393T-G transversion in exon 23 of the SCN9A gene, resulting in a phe1449-to-val (F1449V) substitution in the N terminus of loop 3, which joins domains III and IV of the protein. The mutation was not identified in 5 unaffected family members or in 100 control chromosomes. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the F1449V mutant protein produced a hyperpolarizing shift in channel activation and a depolarizing shift in steady-state activation, lowering the threshold for single action potentials and high frequency firing in dorsal root ganglion neurons. The findings were consistent with a gain-of-function mutation. \r\n\r\n","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":160,"end":191},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":199,"end":204},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":211,"end":223},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":226,"end":322},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":330,"end":337},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":488,"end":501},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":510,"end":518},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":521,"end":564},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":571,"end":616},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":618,"end":626},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":631,"end":669},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":674,"end":727},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":765,"end":781},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":782,"end":790},"obj":"Var"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R9","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T13"}]}
