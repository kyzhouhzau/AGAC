(2004) identified a heterozygous 254T-C transition in exon 4 of the PSEN1 gene, resulting in a leu85-to-pro (L85P) substitution. Functional expression studies showed that the L85P mutation resulted in a 2-fold increase in amyloid-beta-42 production. The patient had onset at age 26 years, and symptoms and neuroimaging were consistent with the 'visual variant' of AD in which there is a visuospatial cognitive deficit.
