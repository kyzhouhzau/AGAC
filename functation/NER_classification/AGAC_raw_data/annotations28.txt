(1996) identified heterozygosity for an A-G transition in the MYL3 gene, resulting in a met149-to-val (M149V) substitution at a highly conserved residue. Six of 13 affected family members had unusual mid-left ventricular chamber thickening on echocardiography. An in vitro motility assay of ventricular myosins from 3 mutation-positive individuals demonstrated an increased rate of actin translocation compared to controls. Soleus or deltoid muscle biopsies from the same 3 patients showed myopathic changes and a ragged-red fiber pattern characteristic of primary mitochondrial disease; cytochrome oxidase-positive subsarcolemmal accumulations were confirmed to be mitochondria by electron microscopy. The M149V mutation was not found in 378 control chromosomes or in 762 chromosomes from unrelated CMH kindreds.","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":159,"end":195},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":203,"end":207},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":214,"end":226},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":229,"end":293},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":459,"end":467},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":505,"end":514},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":523,"end":528},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":529,"end":542},"obj":"Var"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T8"}]}
