(2002)reported a homozygous G-to-A transition in exon 4 of the\u00a0NR5A1\u00a0gene, which resulted in an arg92-to-gln (R92Q) amino acid change. This mutation altered a highly conserved residue of the A box, a region that functions as a secondary DNA binding domain. Three relatives of the infant (parents and a sister) were phenotypically normal despite being heterozygous for the mutation. In functional assays, the R92Q mutant exhibited partial loss of DNA binding and transcriptional activity when compared with the G35E P-box change (184757.0001), consistent with its phenotypic expression only when transmitted as a homozygous trait","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":117,"end":145},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":163,"end":168},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":181,"end":192},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":196,"end":233},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":240,"end":248},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":249,"end":256},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":259,"end":283},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":508,"end":512},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":513,"end":519},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":530,"end":542},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":546,"end":557},"obj":"Interaction"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":562,"end":586},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T10"}]}
