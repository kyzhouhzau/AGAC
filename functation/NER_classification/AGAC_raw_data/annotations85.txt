(2011)\u00a0identified a heterozygous 1632G-A transition in exon 8 of the\u00a0ZFPM2\u00a0gene, resulting in a met544-to-ile (M544I) substitution at an evolutionarily conserved residue. Parental DNA was unavailable for analysis; the mutation was not found in 500 population-matched controls.\u00a0\u000B\u000BIn a Moroccan patient with 46,XY sex reversal-9 (SRXY9;\u00a0616067),\u00a0Bashamboo et al. (2014)\u00a0identified heterozygosity for a de novo substitution in the\u00a0ZFPM2\u00a0gene (R260Q;\u00a0603693.0010) as well as homozygosity for the M544I substitution. The proband's unaffected second-cousin parents were each heterozygous for the M544I mutation but did not carry the R260Q variant; neither mutation was found in 400 normospermic ancestry-matched controls.\u00a0Bashamboo et al. (2014)\u00a0noted that there was no reported history of cardiac anomalies in the Moroccan family, and that the Italian patient reported by\u00a0De Luca et al. (2011)\u00a0had no reported gonadal anomalies. In functional assays in HEK293T cells, the M544I mutant demonstrated transactivation activity on the AMH (600957) promoter that was similar to wildtype, although there was a significant reduction in the ability to repress GATA4/NR5A1 (184757)-dependent transactivation of AMH with M544I compared to wildtype. In addition, the M544I mutant exhibited significantly increased activation of the SOX9 (608160) enhancer TESCO compared to wildtype.","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":113,"end":141},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":149,"end":154},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":161,"end":173},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":176,"end":249},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":1190,"end":1199},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1207,"end":1272},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1276,"end":1279},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1285,"end":1290},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1330,"end":1342},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1367,"end":1376},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1377,"end":1423},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T10"}]}
