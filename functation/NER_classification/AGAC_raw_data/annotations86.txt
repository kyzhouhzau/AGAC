(2009)identified a homozygous 373G-A transition in the SLC25A19 gene, resulting in a gly125-to-ser (G125S) substitution in the highly conserved first residue of the third transmembrane domain. Functional complementation studies in yeast showed decreased protein function compared to controls. The phenotype was characterized by recurrent encephalopathic episodes in childhood with essentially full psychomotor recovery, as well as by a chronic progressive polyneuropathy. Cognition was intact.\u00a0Spiegel et al. (2009)noted that the phenotype was much less severe than that described in Amish lethal microcephaly (607196), and suggested that the G125S mutation was less deleterious than the G177A mutation.","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":229,"end":246},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":254,"end":262},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":269,"end":281},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":284,"end":390},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":443,"end":452},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":453,"end":460},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":461,"end":469},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T7"}]}
