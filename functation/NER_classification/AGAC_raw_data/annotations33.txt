(2010),\u00a0Niihori et al. (2015)\u00a0identified heterozygosity for a c.2248C-T transition (c.2248C-T, NM_001105078) in the\u00a0MECOM\u00a0gene, resulting in an arg750-to-trp (R750W) substitution at a highly conserved residue within the eighth zinc finger motif in the C-terminal zinc finger domain. The mutation was not present in his unaffected mother, in 382 ethnically matched controls, or in the dbSNP, 1000 Genomes Project, Human Genetic Variation, or ExAC databases. DNA from the father was not available. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR assays showed a significant reduction in immunoprecipitated DNA with the R750W mutant compared to wildtype EVI1. Luciferase assays using pAP1 (165160)-luc in transfected NIH3T3 and HEK293 cells demonstrated enhanced suppression of relative luciferase activity with the R750W mutant compared to wildtype EVI1, whereas luciferase assays using a p3TP-lux vector showed an attenuated response with the mutant.\u00a0Niihori et al. (2015)\u00a0suggested that the R750W mutant might represent a gain-of-function effect for AP1 and partial loss of function for TGF-beta (190180) signaling.","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":200,"end":241},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":275,"end":280},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":287,"end":299},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":303,"end":337},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":718,"end":727},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":731,"end":753},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":763,"end":768},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":769,"end":775},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":897,"end":905},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":906,"end":949},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":959,"end":964},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":965,"end":971},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1059,"end":1069},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1070,"end":1094},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1137,"end":1142},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1143,"end":1149},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1168,"end":1184},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1196,"end":1199},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1212,"end":1228},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1233,"end":1260},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"T17"},{"id":"R12","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R13","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T17","obj":"T18"},{"id":"R14","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T20","obj":"T18"},{"id":"R15","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T17","obj":"T19"},{"id":"R16","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T21","obj":"T19"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R8","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T10"}]}
