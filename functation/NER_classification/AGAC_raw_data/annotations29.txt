(2002) reported a consanguineous family in which 3 sibs had presented with childhood-onset CMH characterized by midcavitary left-ventricular hypertrophy (CMH8; 608751). Both parents had completely normal hearts in their 40s. Mutation screening in a surviving affected sib revealed a homozygous missense G-to-A point mutation at codon 143 of the MYL3 gene, resulting in a glutamic acid-to-lysine (E143K) substitution. Heterozygotes had normal hearts. Sequence alignment of myosin essential light chains demonstrated high conservation of glutamic acid at position 143 across species. The E143K mutation was absent from 150 normal control DNA samples. The authors concluded that this was a true autosomal recessive form of CMH8.
