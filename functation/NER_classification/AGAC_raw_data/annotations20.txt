(1997) found homozygosity for a 4-bp deletion in the IL2RA gene at nucleotides 60 to 64, resulting in a translational frameshift. Translation proceeded for 20 amino acids before the deletion and resultant frameshift occurred, effectively ablating CD25 expression. A further 25 irrelevant amino acids were added before termination. The homozygous nature of the mutation was confirmed by analysis of sequences from the parents, who both demonstrated a normal and a 4-bp-deleted allele.
