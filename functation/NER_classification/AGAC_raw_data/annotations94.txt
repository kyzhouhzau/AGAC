(2004)\u00a0identified homozygosity for a 4-bp deletion, TTTT, near the 3-prime end of intron 3 of the CYP17A1 gene. RNA derived from the TTTT deletion skipped exon 4 entirely, deleting 29 amino acids in-frame; cells expressing the mutant gene had no 17-hydroxylase activity. The diagnosis in the patient had been based on extremely elevated 11-deoxycorticosterone and corticosterone values, and failure of pubertal progression","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":153,"end":206},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":214,"end":221},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":343,"end":354},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":359,"end":361},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":362,"end":376},"obj":"Enzyme"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":377,"end":385},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":444,"end":452},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":453,"end":501},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"}]}
