(2010)\u00a0identified a hemizygous c.257A-G transition in exon 3 of the\u00a0HSD17B10\u00a0gene, resulting in an asp86-to-gly (D86G) substitution. Patient fibroblasts showed about 30% residual enzymatic activity. The patient had absent neurologic development and died of progressive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy at age 7 months. Patient cells showed punctate and fragmented mitochondrial organization. Transfection of D86G-mutated\u00a0HSD17B10\u00a0into\u00a0HSD17B10-null cells failed to rescue apoptosis. The findings suggested that the mutation causes a defect in mitochondrial function, which is responsible for clinical features of the disorder.","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":111,"end":140},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":148,"end":156},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":163,"end":175},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":179,"end":211},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":246,"end":249},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":259,"end":268},"obj":"Enzyme"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":269,"end":277},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":295,"end":301},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":302,"end":324},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":483,"end":495},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":496,"end":504},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":530,"end":536},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":547,"end":556},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":590,"end":598},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":608,"end":614},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":618,"end":640},"obj":"CPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R10","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T12"}]}
