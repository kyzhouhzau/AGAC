(2007)\u00a0identified a G-to-C transversion in the NR0B1 gene, resulting in a trp105-to-cys (W105C) substitution in the N terminus of\u00a0DAX1. In vitro studies of\u00a0DAX1\u00a0expression and function in transfected cells demonstrated mild loss of both repression and activation functions; structure-function analysis suggested that mutations in the N terminus are compensated by the presence of repeat LXXLL motifs that mediate\u00a0DAX1\u00a0interactions with other proteins. The mutation, which was not found in 100 Dutch controls, was present in the proband's mother; it was also present in 3 asymptomatic male relatives, indicating phenotypic heterogeneity.","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":157,"end":176},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":184,"end":189},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":196,"end":208},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":211,"end":263},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":267,"end":271},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":361,"end":365},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":374,"end":384},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":389,"end":409},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T6"}]}
