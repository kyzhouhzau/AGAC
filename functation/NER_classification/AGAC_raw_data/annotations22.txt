(2007) found by logistic regression analysis that a SNP in intron 1 of IL2RA, rs11594656, added significantly to the effect of ss52580101 (147730.0002) on susceptibility to type 1 diabetes (IDDM10; 601942) (P = 8.19 x 10(-7)). Determination of soluble IL2RA concentration (sIL2RA) for 1,357 case plasma samples found significant association of rs11594656 with sIL2RA (P = 2.15 x 10(-23)). The presence of 2 copies of the susceptibility allele (T) was associated with lower concentrations of sIL2RA compared with the presence of 1 or more copies of the protective allele (A).","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":64,"end":79},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":83,"end":88},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":102,"end":107},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":167,"end":200},"obj":"CPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"}]}
