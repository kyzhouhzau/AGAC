(1996) characterized a human ESR mutant, val364 to glu, which has a single amino acid substitution in its hormone-binding domain. While this mutant is fully active or even superactive at saturating levels of estradiol it also acts as a strong dominant-negative inhibitor of the wildtype ESR and it is able to repress ESR-mediated transcription when the mutant and wildtype ESR are present together in cells, even without DNA binding. It is probable that altered interactions with proteins important in ESR-mediated transcription play a key role in the repression of transcription by val364 to glu.\r\n","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":46,"end":49},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":50,"end":71},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":79,"end":82},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":85,"end":115},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":123,"end":145},"obj":"Interaction"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":158,"end":164},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":174,"end":180},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":189,"end":200},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":204,"end":234},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":260,"end":287},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":304,"end":307},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":326,"end":333},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":334,"end":337},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":347,"end":360},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":471,"end":478},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":479,"end":491},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":497,"end":505},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":519,"end":522},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":532,"end":545},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":569,"end":579},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":583,"end":596},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":600,"end":613},"obj":"Var"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T21"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R14","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R15","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R16","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T16"},{"id":"R17","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T23"},{"id":"R18","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T24"},{"id":"R19","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T24","obj":"T27"},{"id":"R20","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T26","obj":"T27"},{"id":"R21","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T25","obj":"T24"},{"id":"R3","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T18"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T18"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T19"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T20"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T22","obj":"T20"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T22","obj":"T21"}]}
