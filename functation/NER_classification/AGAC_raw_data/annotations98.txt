(1995)\u00a0identified a 1-bp deletion of a G in amino acid 438 in the CYP17A1 gene. The deletion altered the reading frame and resulted in a premature stop codon at position 443. The ligand of heme iron, cystine-442, was absent. The truncated protein showed normal amino acid residues 1-437 and abnormal amino acid residues 438-442. The mutation caused loss of an AvaII restriction site which was used to demonstrate that the mother and a sister were heterozygous for the mutation.\u00a0Oshiro et al. (1995)reported that 16\u00a0CYP17\u00a0allelic variants had been reported","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":143,"end":181},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":189,"end":196},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":207,"end":215},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":216,"end":223},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":228,"end":241},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":246,"end":257},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":260,"end":296},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":456,"end":464},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":472,"end":476},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":483,"end":505},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T9"}]}
