(2011)\u00a0identified a homozygous 304G-C transversion in exon 2 of the\u00a0SIGMAR1\u00a0gene, resulting in a glu102-to-gln (E102Q) substitution in a highly conserved residue in the predicted transmembrane domain. The mutation was not found in 271 controls. In vitro functional expression assays in the motor neuron-like cell line NSC34 showed that the mutant protein was shifted to lower density membranes and formed detergent-resistant complexes. Transfected cells also showed an almost 2-fold increase in apoptosis in response to stress compared to controls. The findings indicated that the mutation decreases the viability of motor neurons. The patients had a very early age of onset, at 1 to 2 years, of lower limb spasticity and weakness. The disorder was slowly progressive, and involved the upper limbs. Two patients were wheelchair-bound by age 20 years. None of the patients had bulbar or respiratory involvement, and all had normal cognition.\u00a0\u000B\u000BFukunaga et al. (2015)\u00a0found that transfection of the E102Q mutation into neuro2A cells resulted in dissociation of the mutant protein from the ER membrane and subsequent cytoplasmic aggregation. This was associated with disruption of mitochondrial structure, mitochondrial damage, decreased ATP production, and autophagic cell death. Cells overexpressing E102Q showed aberrant extranuclear localization of TDP43 (605078), a hallmark of AL","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":137,"end":166},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":174,"end":181},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":188,"end":200},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":203,"end":305},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":504,"end":510},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":511,"end":540},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":589,"end":597},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":601,"end":632},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":687,"end":695},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":696,"end":705},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":710,"end":736},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1103,"end":1117},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1149,"end":1161},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1169,"end":1175},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1176,"end":1183},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1220,"end":1243},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1270,"end":1280},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1284,"end":1307},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1309,"end":1322},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1323,"end":1329},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1331,"end":1340},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1341,"end":1355},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1361,"end":1382},"obj":"CPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"T16"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R12","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T19","obj":"T18"},{"id":"R13","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T20","obj":"T21"},{"id":"R15","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T24","obj":"T22"},{"id":"R16","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T23","obj":"T22"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R8","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R9","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T16","obj":"T14"}]}
