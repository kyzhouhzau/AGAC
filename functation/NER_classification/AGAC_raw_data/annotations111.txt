(2007)\u00a0found compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the\u00a0HIBCH\u00a0gene. The patient presented with progressive infantile neurodegeneration and was born of nonconsanguineous parents. The patient had no structural abnormalities of the brain or heart and no dysmorphic facial features, and was alive at time of report. The 2 mutations were a 365A-G transition resulting in a tyr122-to-cys substitution (Y122C) carried on the maternal allele, and a splice acceptor site mutation, IVS2-3C-G (610690.0003), carried on the paternal allele. The missense mutation predicted the substitution of the bulky amino acid residue tyrosine, which is conserved among different species. The splice site transversion disrupted the consensus sequence for a splice acceptor site, given that a pyrimidine (cytosine or thymine) is preferred over guanine at this position in the consensus sequence. The significance of this mutation on splicing was investigated by analysis of\u00a0HIBCH\u00a0cDNA. Sequence analysis revealed a heterozygous 2-bp insertion resulting from retention of the 3-prime end of intron 2, causing a frameshift (Arg27fsTer50). The intronic DNA sequence adjacent to the IVS2-3C-G mutation showed strong homology to the consensus sequence of a splice acceptor site, with identity at 9 of 10 intronic bases.\u00a0Loupatty et al. (2007)found that heterozygosity for the 2 mutations resulted in complete absence of\u00a0HIBCH\u00a0activity in the patient, indicative of a pathogenetic effect in both mutations.","project":"AGAC-2-2","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":419,"end":428},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":436,"end":453},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":454,"end":466},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":469,"end":495},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":540,"end":582},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":634,"end":651},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":652,"end":661},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":666,"end":719},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1103,"end":1117},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1118,"end":1132},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1133,"end":1173},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1175,"end":1182},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1185,"end":1195},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1448,"end":1457},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1479,"end":1486},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1490,"end":1495},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1496,"end":1504},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"T17"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R9","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T15"}]}
