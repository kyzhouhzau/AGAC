GABRG2_28505490_1	GOF	The study indicated that regardless of other inflammatory factors , brief heat alone increased brain excitability and induced multiple types of seizures in Gabrg2+/Q390X mice , suggesting that mutations like GABRG2 ( Q390X ) may alter brain thermal regulation and precipitate seizures during temperature elevations . 
GABRG2_27066572_3	LOF	This study provides evidence that GABRG2 mutations are linked to the FS phenotype , rather than epilepsy , and that loss-of-function of GABAA receptor y2 subunit is the probable underlying pathogenic mechanism . 
GABRG2_25726841_1	LOF	Restoring the impaired membrane trafficking of some GABRG2 mutations by enhancing palmitoylation might be an interesting therapeutic approach to reverse the pathogenic effect of such mutants . 
GABRG2_23720301_1	LOF	RESULTS : Although all GABRG2 nonsense mutations resulted in loss of y2 subunit surface expression , the truncated subunits had different degradation rates and stabilities , suppression of wild-type subunit biogenesis and function , amounts of conjugation with polyubiquitin , and endoplasmic reticulum stress levels . 
GABRG2_22539854_1	LOF	Wild-type and mutant GABRG2 mRNA splicing patterns were determined in both BAC-transfected HEK293T cells and transgenic mouse brain , and in both , the mutation abolished intron 6 splicing at the donor site , activated a cryptic splice site , generated partial intron 6 retention , and produced a frameshift in exon 7 that created a premature translation termination codon ( PTC ) . 
GABRG2_22539854_2	LOF	These results suggested that the GABRG2 mutation , IVS6+2T > G , reduced surface aby2 receptor levels , thus reducing GABAergic inhibition , by reducing GABRG2 transcript level and producing a stable , nonfunctional truncated subunit that had a dominant-negative effect on aby2 receptor assembly . 
GABRG2_17615250_3	GOF	Subjects affected by the GABRG2 ( R43Q ) mutation demonstrated reduced net short-interval intracortical inhibition and increased intracortical facilitation assessed with paired-pulse stimulation . 
GABRG2_17615250_4	GOF	Our findings provide in vivo evidence for increased intracortical excitability in subjects affected by the GABRG2 ( R43Q ) mutation . 
GABRG2_16875845_0	LOF	We tested the hypothesis that individuals affected by the GABRG2 ( R43Q ) mutation have reduced binding to the GABA ( A ) receptor complex using positron emission tomography ( PET ) and the benzodiazepine receptor ligand [ ( 11 ) C ] -flumazenil . 
ARX_24122442_1	LOF	We propose that this temporal difference in the loss of Lmo1 repression may be one of the causes accounting for the phenotypic differences identified between the Arx ( ( GCG ) 7 ) and Arx ( 432-455dup24 ) mouse models .  It is yet to be determined what effect these mutations have on ARX protein in affected males in the human setting . 
ARX_22194193_1	LOF	Luciferase reporter assays showed altered repression activity of ARX by all mutations , causing brain malformations and ISSX-ID phenotypes , but not by the P353L mutation implicated in a milder phenotype of XMESID . 
ARX_22194193_3	LOF	In conclusion , the missense mutations in the ARX homeodomain represent loss-of-function mutations , which lead to a reduced or complete loss of DNA binding and as a consequence , a loss of transcriptional repression . 
ARX_20148114_5	LOF	Surprisingly , none of these mutations abolished the binding of ARX to IPO13 . 
ARX_19738637_2	LOF	The ARX mutation identified is predicted to yield a severely truncated protein of only 26 amino acids and can be considered as a null mutation . 
ARX_16806828_2	LOF	Individuals with lissencephaly due to ARX mutation lack non-pyramidal or GABAergic interneurons . 
ARX_15248097_0	LOF	Genetic analysis of the ARX gene revealed a novel frameshift mutation in exon 4 ( nt1419_1420insAC ) leading to a shortened protein lacking the aristaless domain . 
ALDH7A1_20887371_0	GOF	PDE can be identified by increased urinary alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde ( a-AASA ) concentrations and mutations in the ALDH7A1 ( antiquitin ) gene . 
ALDH7A1_19142996_1	GOF	RESULTS : Both patients reported here had increased CSF alpha-AASA , CSF pipecolic acid , and known or likely pathogenic mutations in the ALDH7A1 gene , consistent with alpha-AASA dehydrogenase deficiency . 
ALDH7A1_16491085_0	LOF	We show here that children with pyridoxine-dependent seizures ( PDS ) have mutations in the ALDH7A1 gene , which encodes antiquitin ; these mutations abolish the activity of antiquitin as a delta1-piperideine-6-carboxylate ( P6C ) -alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde ( alpha-AASA ) dehydrogenase . 
HCN1_29936235_3	LOF	Electrophysiological analysis in heterologous expression model ( CHO cells ) and in neurons revealed that L157V is a loss-of-function , dominant negative mutation causing reduced HCN1 contribution to net inward current and responsible for an increased neuronal firing rate and excitability , potentially predisposing to epilepsy . 
GRIN2B_28533163_0	GOF	De novo gain of function mutations in GRIN2B encoding the GluN2B subunit of the N-methyl-d-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor have been linked with epileptic encephalopathies , including infantile spasms . 
DEPDC5_29761115_2	LOF	No phenotypic rescue was obtained upon expression of epilepsy-associated DEPDC5 mutations ( p.Arg487* and p.Arg485Gln ) , indicating that these mutations cause a loss of function of the protein . 
CLCN2_17156979_0	LOF	Analysis of these isoforms in brain tissue containing epileptic foci suggests that CLCN2 could be implicated in epilepsy , even in the absence of mutations . 
NHLRC1_21742036_0	LOF	Lafora disease ( LD ) is the inherited progressive myoclonus epilepsy caused by mutations in either EPM2A gene , encoding the protein phosphatase laforin or the NHLRC1 gene , encoding the ubiquitin ligase malin . 
PNKP_22508754_3	LOF	Critically , all of the MCSZ mutations identified to date result in 10-fold reduced cellular levels of PNKP protein , and reduced rates of chromosomal DNA strand break repair . 
PNKP_22508754_4	LOF	Together , these data suggest that all four known MCSZ mutations reduce the cellular stability and level of PNKP protein , with three mutations likely ablating cellular DNA 5'-kinase activity and all of the mutations greatly reducing cellular DNA 3'-phosphatase activity . 
SCN3A_28235671_1	GOF	Biophysical characterization of epilepsy-associated SCN3A variants suggests that both gain- and loss-of-function SCN3A mutations may lead to increased seizure susceptibility . 
MECP2_27328321_0	LOF	UNASSIGNED : The postnatal neurodevelopmental disorder Rett syndrome , caused by mutations in MECP2 , produces a diverse array of symptoms , including loss of language , motor , and social skills and the development of hand stereotypies , anxiety , tremor , ataxia , respiratory dysrhythmias , and seizures . 
MECP2_25789914_0	LOF	OBJECTIVE : Rett syndrome is an X-linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene , and characterized by cognitive and communicative regression , loss of hand use , and midline hand stereotypies . 
MECP2_21829232_0	LOF	RTT is caused by mutations in methyl-CpG binding protein 2 ( MECP2 ) , an X-chromosome gene encoding for MeCP2 , a protein that regulates gene expression . 
MECP2_19087113_0	LOF	Many example illustrate the lack of impact of genetic information on the treatment outcome : we do not treat Dravet syndrome more successfully since SCN1A testing became available ; we do not treat Lafora disease more successfully since testing for laforin and malin became available ; we do not need to know the genetic nature of Unverricht-Lundborg disease or test for the cystatin B mutation in order to select or avoid certain drugs ; we do not treat Rett syndrome more successfully since MECP2 testing became available ; we do not treat JME more successfully since we know its genetic origin ; we do not treat autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy more successfully since we know its genetic origin and can test for its mutation . 
MECP2_17980307_0	LOF	Rett syndrome is caused by a mutation in the MECP2 gene located on Xq28 , whereas Angelman syndrome results from the loss of UBE3A function on chromosomal region 15q11-q13 related to a variety of molecular genetic mechanisms . 
MECP2_17584923_0	LOF	MECP2 mutations in females lead to Rett syndrome , a neurological disorder characterized by developmental stagnation and regression , loss of purposeful hand movements and speech , stereotypic hand movements , deceleration of brain growth , autonomic dysfunction and seizures . 
MECP2_17276711_0	LOF	Rett syndrome ( RS ) is an X-linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in MECP2 ( Xq28 ) and characterized by normal development until 6-12 months of age , followed by regression with loss of acquired skills , gradual onset of microcephaly , stereotypic hand movements and psychomotor delay . 
MECP2_15791137_1	GOF	Understanding of the influence of the MECP2 mutation on other neurodevelopmental disorders has increased . 
NEDD4L_28515470_3	GOF	Although mutations in the HECT domain of NEDD4L that lead to AKT-mTOR pathway deregulation in forced expression system were reported , our western blot analysis did not show an increased level of AKT-mTOR activity in lymphoblastoid cell lines ( LCLs ) derived from the patient . 
ITPA_26224535_0	LOF	In all patients , WES subsequently revealed recessive predicted loss of function mutations in ITPA , encoding inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase ( ITPase ) . 
ADSL_23937257_0	LOF	ADSL gene sequencing revealed a previously described c.-49T > C mutation and a novel c.889_891dupAAT mutation , which was likely to disrupt enzyme function . 
ADSL_18830228_0	GOF	Both patients had an increased succinyladenosine/SAICAr ratio of 1.6 , and exhibited a novel homozygous missense mutation ( c.674T > C ; p.Met225Thr ) in the exon 6 of the ADSL gene . 
ADSL_16839792_0	LOF	Both the presence of normal levels of ADSL enzyme activities in some patient tissues and the absence of a clear correlation between mutations , biochemistry , and behavior show that the system has unexplored biochemical and/or genetic complexity .  It is unclear whether the pathological mechanisms of this disease result from a deficiency of purines , a toxicity of intermediates , or perturbation of another pathway or system . 
DYRK1A_25920557_2	LOF	On the basis of increasing identification of mutations in DYRK1A , we suggest that this gene be considered potentially causative in patients presenting with ID , primary or acquired microcephaly , feeding problems and absent or delayed speech with or without seizures.European Journal of Human Genetics advance online publication , 29 April 2015 ; doi:10.1038/ejhg.2015.29 . 
ALDH5A1_25246302_1	GOF	The diagnosis of succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency was confirmed by increased level of y-hydroxybutyric acid in urine and novel compound heterozygous mutations in the ALDH5A1 gene . 
ALDH5A1_21612881_0	GOF	The diagnosis of SSADH deficiency was confirmed by an increase in 4-hydroxybutyric acid and heteroallelic mutation in the ALDH5A1 gene . 
AR_24114805_1	LOF	INTERPRETATION : The identified mutation is responsible for ADCME , as the loss of a2B -AR/spinophilin interaction causes a gain of function effect . 
PAX6_12731001_0	LOF	With magnetic resonance imaging in 24 humans heterozygous for defined PAX6 mutations , we demonstrated widespread structural abnormalities including absence of the pineal gland and unilateral polymicrogyria . 
CYP2C19_11673755_0	LOF	In the absence of any acquired predisposing factor for phenytoin toxicity , genetic mutations in the cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) enzymes responsible for phenytoin metabolism ( CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 ) were suspected . 
CYP2C19_11673755_1	LOF	In view of the markedly reduced metabolic activity of CYP2C*3 in comparison with the wild-type enzyme ( about one fifth ) and of the minor role of CYP2C19 in phenytoin metabolism , it is likely that CYP2C9*3 mutation was largely responsible for drug overdose . 
CYP2C19_8874828_0	LOF	The maximal elimination rate ( Vmax ) of phenytoin was slightly decreased ( up to 14 % ) in patients with CYP2C19 mutations for the defective allele . 
SNAP25_29491473_3	LOF	Comparing clinical features of reported patients with SNAP25 mutations , the current patients demonstrated apparently milder clinical features with normal intelligence , and no magnetic resonance imaging abnormality or facial dysmorphism . 
ATP1A2_15907261_0	GOF	The increased number of mutations in the FHM1 ( CACNA1A ) and the FHM2 ( ATP1A2 ) genes allow studying the relationship between genetic findings in both genes and the clinical features in patients . 
ATP1A2_15549578_1	GOF	In the case of ATP1A2 mutations , haplo-insufficiency of the gene has been hypothesised to result in abnormal potassium level regulation because of faulty Na/K exchange with subsequent depolarisation and increased liability to spreading depression , or/and in abnormal calcium levels because of the concomitant activation of the Na/Ca exchanger , with a mechanism therefore comparable to that at work in FHM1 . 
SNX14_25439728_0	LOF	Here we report the identification of causal mutations in Sorting Nexin 14 ( SNX14 ) found in seven affected individuals from three unrelated consanguineous families who presented with recessively inherited moderate-severe intellectual disability , cerebellar ataxia , early-onset cerebellar atrophy , sensorineural hearing loss , and the distinctive association of progressively coarsening facial features , relative macrocephaly , and the absence of seizures . 
SNX14_25439728_2	LOF	All three mutations either directly affected the PX domain or diminished SNX14 levels , implicating a loss of normal cellular function . 
AKT3_26523971_0	GOF	Within human FMCD-affected brain , we found that cells showing activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway were enriched for the AKT3 ( E17K ) mutation . 
AKT3_25722288_0	GOF	We identified mosaic activating mutations in PIK3CA and AKT3 in this cohort , including cancer-associated hotspot PIK3CA mutations in dysplastic megalencephaly , hemimegalencephaly , and focal cortical dysplasia type IIa .

AKT3_25091978_0	GOF	Somatic and germline duplications or activating mutations of AKT3 have been reported in patients with hemimegalencephaly and megalencephaly . 
AKT3_22500628_0	GOF	A third case showed a known activating mutation in AKT3 ( c.49G > A , creating p.E17K ) that was not present in the patient 's blood cells . 
DCX_20164125_0	GOF	Previous reports indicate that in utero knockdown of doublecortin ( DCX ) results in the genesis of a subcortical heterotopia reminiscent of the doublecortex observed in female patients with DCX mutations .  It has also been shown that these rats display an increased susceptibility to convulsant agents and increased cortical neurons excitability ; but it is presently unknown whether they display spontaneous seizures . 
DCX_17343267_0	LOF	Given the lack of mutation in known lissencephaly genes such as LIS1 , 14-3-3epsilon , and DCX , this syndrome may constitute a new phenotype with autosomal recessive inheritance . 
TK2_18504129_0	LOF	Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome ( MDS ) is characterized by a reduction in mtDNA copy number and has been associated with mutations in eight nuclear genes , including enzymes involved in mitochondrial nucleotide metabolism ( POLG , TK2 , DGUOK , SUCLA2 , SUCLG1 , PEO1 ) and MPV17 . 
UBE3A_20301323_1	LOF	The risk to sibs of a proband depends on the genetic mechanism leading to the loss of UBE3A function : typically less than 1 % risk for probands with a deletion or UPD , and as high as 50 % for probands with an ID or a mutation of UBE3A . 
UBE3A_28411125_0	GOF	Maternally-derived deletions or inactivating mutations of UBE3A , a 15q11-13 gene expressed exclusively from the maternal allele in neurons , cause Angelman syndrome , characterized by intellectual disability , motor deficits , seizures , and a characteristic increased social smiling , laughing , and eye contact . 
UBE3A_25848016_0	LOF	Angelman syndrome ( AS ) is a neurodevelopmental disorder arising from loss-of-function mutations in the maternally inherited copy of the UBE3A gene , and is characterized by an absence of speech , excessive laughter , cognitive delay , motor deficits , and seizures . 
UBE3A_24470816_0	LOF	Loss of the maternally contributed AS region can occur by deletion , paternal uniparental disomy , imprinting defects , mutation of the ubiquitin-protein ligase ( UBE3A ) gene , and by yet unidentified mechanisms . 
UBE3A_22787634_0	LOF	In human , three different point mutations in exon 1A , coding the signal peptide and exon 2 of GABRB3 , segregate with childhood absence epilepsy ( CAE ) , and result in decreased neuronal GABA currents , Three neurological disorders , Rett syndrome , ( a deficiency of MeCP2 ) , Angelman syndrome , and autism , each exhibit reduced expression of GABRB3 and UBE3A , along with mental retardation and epilepsy . 
UBE3A_20445456_1	LOF	The risk to sibs of a proband depends on the genetic mechanism of the loss of the maternally contributed Angelman syndrome/Prader-Willi syndrome region : typically < 1 % for probands with a deletion or uniparental disomy ; as high as 50 % for probands with an imprinting defect or a mutation of UBE3A . 
UBE3A_20445456_2	LOF	Members of the mother 's extended family are also at increased risk when an imprinting defect or a UBE3A mutation is present . 
UBE3A_20034088_0	LOF	We identified in a large Tunisian pedigree a novel UBE3A frameshift mutation in exon 16 coding region , and we expect that the resulting UBE3A truncated protein in our patients is non-functional since the mutation implies the catalytic region of the enzyme . 
UBE3A_18487518_0	LOF	The syndrome results from lack of function of the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene on the imprinted Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome critical region ; it is caused by large deletions , paternal uniparental disomy , imprinting center defects or UBE3A deletions , and point mutations . 
UBE3A_17980307_0	LOF	Rett syndrome is caused by a mutation in the MECP2 gene located on Xq28 , whereas Angelman syndrome results from the loss of UBE3A function on chromosomal region 15q11-q13 related to a variety of molecular genetic mechanisms . 
UBE3A_17036311_0	LOF	Chromosome deletions of 15q11q13 , paternal uniparental disomy ( UPD ) , UBE3A gene mutations , and imprinting center defects are all commonly recognized mechanisms that disrupt the function of the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene . 
UBE3A_17009341_1	LOF	We describe the case of a pregnant woman having two nephews with AS caused by a UBE3A mutation ; lack of communication within the family led the woman to be completely unaware of the risk of disease recurrence until 15 weeks of gestation . 
UBE3A_14981718_1	GOF	By combining our data with those of the literature , we demonstrate statistically that the frequency of UBE3A mutations is significantly higher in the familial than sporadic subsets of AS . 
UBE3A_12749060_0	LOF	AS results from the loss of expression of a maternal imprinted gene , UBE3A , mapped within 15q11-q13 region , due to different mechanisms : maternal deletion , paternal UPD , imprinting center mutation , and UBE3A mutation .

PDCD10_16571644_0	LOF	Familial forms have been linked to three chromosomal loci , and loss of function mutations have been identified in the KRIT1/CCM1 , MGC4607/CCM2 , and PDCD10/CCM3 genes . 
KIF1A_28970574_4	LOF	A structural modeling revealed that the p.T258M mutation disrupted the binding of KIF1A motor domain to microtubules and its movement along microtubules . 
KIF1A_28970574_5	LOF	Assays of peripheral accumulation and proximal distribution of KIF1A motor indicated that the KIF1A motor domain with p.T258M mutation has reduced motor activity and exerts a dominant negative effect on wild-type KIF1A . 
KIF1A_27146152_0	LOF	We also identified a recurrent de novo mutation in the KIF1A gene and a molybdenum cofactor deficiency caused by the loss of the start codon in the MOCS2A open-reading frame in a mildly affected subject .

TCF4_23165966_0	LOF	No significant difference in clinical severity has been reported to date between PTHS patients carrying 18q21 deletions including the TCF4 gene , and those harboring TCF4 point mutations , suggesting a lack of genotype/phenotype correlation . 
TCF4_22678594_2	LOF	This scoring system is also proposed for a clinically based diagnosis of PTHS in absence of a proven TCF4 mutation . 
TCF4_19938247_2	GOF	CONCLUSIONS : On the basis of an analysis of published cases , we propose a genotype-phenotype correlation of increased seizure activity with missense TCF4 mutations . 
HOMER1_29267967_0	LOF	In-depth functional studies showed that a frame-shift mutation , FRMPD4p.Cys618ValfsX8 , results in a disruption of FRMPD4 binding with PSD-95 and HOMER1 , and a failure to increase spine density in transfected hippocampal neurons . 
GABRB3_28053010_3	LOF	CONCLUSIONS : Our results indicate that GABRB3 mutations are associated with a broad phenotypic spectrum of epilepsies and that reduced receptor function causing GABAergic disinhibition represents the relevant disease mechanism . 
GABRB3_26950270_1	LOF	RESULTS : LGS-associated GABRB3 ( D120N , E180G , Y302C ) mutations located at b+ subunit interfaces reduced whole cell currents by decreasing single channel open probability without loss of surface receptors . 
GABRB3_22787634_0	LOF	In human , three different point mutations in exon 1A , coding the signal peptide and exon 2 of GABRB3 , segregate with childhood absence epilepsy ( CAE ) , and result in decreased neuronal GABA currents , Three neurological disorders , Rett syndrome , ( a deficiency of MeCP2 ) , Angelman syndrome , and autism , each exhibit reduced expression of GABRB3 and UBE3A , along with mental retardation and epilepsy . 
KCNQ2_28078031_0	LOF	In wild type and mis-sense mutations of KCNQ2 proteins , calmodulin over-expression enhanced outward K ( + ) current and decreased neuronal activity . 
KCNQ2_25385787_1	LOF	We introduced cysteine mutations into the S4 transmembrane segment of the KCNQ2 VSD and determined that external application of Cd ( 2+ ) profoundly reduced the current amplitude of S4 cysteine mutants S195C , R198C , and R201C . 
KCNQ2_24555524_0	LOF	BACKGROUND : KCNQx genes encode slowly activating-inactivating K+ channels , are linked to physiological signal transduction pathways , and mutations in them underlie diseases such as long QT syndrome ( KCNQ1 ) , epilepsy in adults ( KCNQ2/3 ) , benign familial neonatal convulsions in children ( KCNQ3 ) , and hearing loss or tinnitus in humans ( KCNQ4 , but not KCNQ5 ) . 
KCNQ2_24318194_1	LOF	INTERPRETATION : The development of severe epilepsy and cognitive decline in children carrying 5 of the 7 studied KCNQ2 mutations can be related to a dominant-negative reduction of the resulting potassium current at subthreshold membrane potentials . 
KCNQ2_23290024_0	LOF	We describe a novel mutation ( c.1126_1127delA ) in exon 9 of KCNQ2 , the gene encoding for the Kv7.2 channel , in a large Emirati family with benign familial neonatal seizures type 1 .  The mutation leads to a frameshift at amino acid position 376 , triggering loss of function and haploinsufficiency . 
KCNQ2_26835270_2	LOF	Immunostaining of transfected cells showed the expression of both the wild type and mutant molecules on the plasma membrane , which suggested that the c.812G > T mutation at the pore forming region of KCNQ2 channel did not impair normal protein expression in HEK293 cells . 
KCNQ2_21849107_2	LOF	Immunostaining of transfected cells showed the expression of both the wild type and mutant molecules on the plasma membrane , which suggested that the c.812G > T mutation at the pore forming region of KCNQ2 channel did not impair normal protein expression in HEK293 cells . 
KCNQ2_18640800_1	LOF	RESULTS : A novel heterozygous mutation ( c.910-2delTTC or TTT , Phe304del ) of KCNQ2 was identified in the patient .  The mutation was de novo verified by parentage analysis .  The mutation was associated with impaired functions of KCNQ K ( + ) channel . 
KCNQ2_18246739_3	LOF	The absence of the mutation both in the healthy members of the family and in a control group , and the lack of any other change in the KCNQ2 gene of the patients indicate that N258S substitution is a pathogenic mutation leading to epileptic seizures in this family . 
KCNQ2_17872363_0	LOF	RESULTS : In a patient with PNH without other neurologic symptoms , we identified a novel KCNQ2 mutation predicting loss of a charged residue within the voltage sensor of K ( V ) 7.2 ( R207Q ) . 
KCNQ2_16735477_0	LOF	We further show that several BFNC mutations of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 disrupt surface expression or polarized surface distribution of KCNQ channels , thereby revealing impaired targeting of KCNQ channels to axonal surfaces as a BFNC etiology . 
KCNQ2_16260777_1	LOF	The 2043deltaT mutation abolished voltage-gated K+ currents produced upon homomeric expression of KCNQ2 subunits , dramatically reduced the steady-state cellular levels of KCNQ2 subunits , and prevented their delivery to the plasma membrane . 
KCNQ2_16260777_2	LOF	Collectively , the present results suggest that mutation-induced reduced stability of KCNQ2 subunits may cause epilepsy in neonates . 
KCNQ2_14534157_1	LOF	In the Xenopus oocyte expression system , we characterize five KCNQ2 and one KCNQ3 disease-causing mutations .  These mutations cause a variable loss of function , and selective effects on the biophysical properties of KCNQ2/KCNQ3 heteromultimeric channels . 
KCNQ2_11784811_0	LOF	Here we show that KCNQ2/KCNQ3 channels carrying a novel BFNC-causing mutation leading to an arginine to tryptophan substitution in the voltage-sensing S4 domain of KCNQ2 subunits ( R214W ) displayed slower opening and faster closing kinetics and a decreased voltage sensitivity with no concomitant changes in maximal current or plasma membrane expression . 
SCN1A_30123852_0	LOF	Dravet Syndrome is a devastating childhood epilepsy disorder with high incidence of premature death plus comorbidities of ataxia , circadian rhythm disorder , impaired sleep quality , autistic-like social-interaction deficits and severe cognitive impairment .  It is primarily caused by heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the SCN1A gene that encodes brain voltage-gated sodium channel type-1 , termed NaV1.1 . 
SCN1A_29692967_1	GOF	Cases of fatal cerebral edema in patients with SCN1A mutations after fever and status epilepticus have been recently reported raising the question whether sodium channel dysfunction may contribute to cerebral edema and thereby contribute to the increased premature mortality in Dravet Syndrome . 
SCN1A_29337050_0	LOF	Loss of function mutations in the SCN1A gene , which encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.1 , have been described in the majority of Dravet syndrome patients presenting with epileptic seizures , hyperactivity , autistic traits , and cognitive decline . 
SCN1A_28865303_0	LOF	Hence , the review will focus on the mutations that impair GABAergic signaling and selectively discuss the newly identified STXBP1 , PRRT2 , and DNM1 in addition to those long-established epilepsy ion channel genes that also impair GABAergic signaling like SCN1A and GABAA receptor subunit genes . 
SCN1A_28441824_0	LOF	Result : Twenty-two patients ( 9 males and 13 females ) with AE were collected among 412 DS patients during follow-up.Of which 18 patients had SCN1A gene mutations while the remaining 4 patients had no SCN1A gene mutations.The onset age of AE was between 6 months and 10 years.The duration of SE varied between 40 minutes and 9 hours.Prior to the onset of SE , twenty-one patients had high fever , and one patient had normal temperature.Coma lasted from 2 days to 20 days.Nine patients died after the AE , and 13 patients survived with massive neurological regression.From AE to the last visit , the median time of follow-up was 2 years and 3 months ( from 7 months to 4 years and 4 months ) . 
SCN1A_26694226_0	GOF	We have previously reported that mice heterozygous for the SCN1A R1648H mutation identified in a GEFS+ family have infrequent spontaneous seizures , increased susceptibility to chemically and hyperthermia-induced generalized seizures and sleep abnormalities . 
SCN1A_24990319_1	LOF	Electrophysiological characterization has revealed that most SCN1A mutations in the pore region result in complete loss of function . 
SCN1A_24955329_0	LOF	An adult woman with Dravet syndrome ( documented SCN1A mutation ) experienced a marked reduction in seizures when treated with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) fluoxetine . 
SCN1A_24902755_4	LOF	Although epidemiology does not support a causative role for SCN1A mutations , loss or impaired protein function combined with the effect of susceptibility factors and genetic modifiers of the phenotypic expression of SCN1A mutations might play a role . 
SCN1A_24805083_1	GOF	We recently demonstrated that Drosophila knock-in flies carrying the K1270T SCN1A mutation known to cause a form of genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus ( GEFS+ ) exhibit a heat-induced increase in sodium current activity and seizure phenotype . 
SCN1A_24709890_0	GOF	There has been a marked increase in genetic diagnoses of a number of key childhood-onset epilepsy syndromes , such as Dravet syndrome , which has been linked to mutations in the SCN1A gene . 
SCN1A_24152123_1	GOF	Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in SCN1A result in Dravet syndrome , a severe infant-onset epileptic encephalopathy characterized by intractable seizures , developmental delays and increased mortality . 
SCN1A_23424217_0	LOF	An extreme example is Dravet syndrome ( DS ) , an infantile-onset severe epilepsy caused by heterozygous loss of function mutations in SCN1A , the gene encoding the brain type-I voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.1 . 
SCN1A_23086956_0	LOF	Our findings indicate that certain nontruncating SCN1A mutations associated with SMEI have impaired cell surface expression and that some alleles may be amenable to pharmacological rescue of this defect . 
SCN1A_23065439_0	GOF	SCN1A mutations are found in up to 80 % of patients with Dravet syndrome ( DS ) , and the sudden unexpected death in epilepsy ( SUDEP ) rate is higher in DS than in most forms of severe epilepsy . 
SCN1A_22905747_0	LOF	SCN1A mutations are associated with a variety of epilepsy syndromes ; the more severe syndromes are associated with truncation or complete loss of function of the protein . 
SCN1A_22780858_3	LOF	SCN1A mutations were divided into four different groups based on location or effect of the mutation . 
SCN1A_22150645_1	LOF	About 50 % of SCN1A DS mutations truncate Na ( V ) 1.1 , possibly causing complete loss of its function . 
SCN1A_21504425_2	LOF	Depending on the series reported and their recruitment strategies , the yield of SCN1A mutations detected varied from 50 to 80 % , implying that other genes or factors must be involved in these 'SCN1A-negative Dravet patients ' . 
SCN1A_21463276_1	LOF	Recent descriptions of Rasmussen syndrome and of the hemiconvulsion-hemiplegia syndrome in isolated patients with SCN1A mutations are of uncertain meaning but might indicate that co-occurring immunomediated or seizure-induced structural changes can , in turn , become a substrate for the severe epileptic encephalopathy . 
SCN1A_21426328_1	GOF	The selectivity of cerebellar white matter change suggests a different mechanism of injury or increased susceptibility of this brain region to injury in at least some patients with SCN1A mutations . 
SCN1A_20831750_1	LOF	Many different biophysical effects of SCN1A-GEFS+ mutations have been observed in heterologous expression systems , consistent with both gain and loss of channel activity . 
SCN1A_20831750_2	LOF	Decreased activity of the inhibitory circuitry is thus likely to be a major factor contributing to seizure generation in patients with GEFS+ and DS , and may be a general consequence of SCN1A mutations . 
SCN1A_20550552_2	LOF	RESULTS : Two heterozygous de novo mutations of SCN1A ( R946H and F1765L ) were detected , which were proven to cause loss of function of Na ( v ) 1.1 . 
SCN1A_20550552_3	LOF	CONCLUSIONS : Isolated milder PEFS+ may associate with SCN1A mutations and loss of function of Na ( v ) 1.1 , which may be the basis of seizure aggravation by sodium channel-blocking AEDs . 
SCN1A_20100831_1	LOF	These results suggest that this SCN1A mutation predominantly impairs sodium channel activity in interneurons , leading to decreased inhibition . 
SCN1A_19666879_1	LOF	An SCN1A mutation can potentially result in either a gain or loss of sodium channel function . 
SCN1A_19673951_3	GOF	Furthermore , whether the migraine of the mother could be influenced by her SCN1A mutation mosaicism is not known , but increased awareness of migraine in future studies of SCN1A related epilepsies could clarify this intriguing link between migraine and epilepsy . 
SCN1A_19589774_4	GOF	CONCLUSIONS : The greater frequency of paternally derived mutations in SCN1A is likely to be due to the greater chance of mutational events during the increased number of mitoses which occur during spermatogenesis compared to oogenesis , and the greater susceptibility to mutagenesis of the methylated DNA characteristic of sperm cells . 
SCN1A_19586930_3	LOF	RESULTS : Meta-analysis quantitatively revealed that the physicochemical properties of several amino acids significantly affected epilepsy phenotype severity .  It showed that missense mutations that decreased protein hydrophobicity were significantly associated with severe epilepsy phenotypes .  It also showed that the phenotype severity of SCN1A missense mutations in the transmembrane domains of SCN1A ( 128/155 ; 82.6 % ) could be predicted with high sensitivity and positive predictive values using the physicochemical property changes , indicating the possibility of phenotype prediction for entirely new missense mutations using analytical methods . 
SCN1A_19409490_1	LOF	These results demonstrate that the effects of SCN1A mutations are cell type-dependent and that the R1648H mutation specifically leads to a reduction in interneuron excitability . 
SCN1A_19087113_3	LOF	Many example illustrate the lack of impact of genetic information on the treatment outcome : we do not treat Dravet syndrome more successfully since SCN1A testing became available ; we do not treat Lafora disease more successfully since testing for laforin and malin became available ; we do not need to know the genetic nature of Unverricht-Lundborg disease or test for the cystatin B mutation in order to select or avoid certain drugs ; we do not treat Rett syndrome more successfully since MECP2 testing became available ; we do not treat JME more successfully since we know its genetic origin ; we do not treat autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy more successfully since we know its genetic origin and can test for its mutation . 
SCN1A_18632234_0	LOF	The gene encoding voltage-gated sodium channel alpha1-subunit : SCN1A analysis revealed a heterozygous de novo one-point mutation ( IVS16+2 T > C ) at a splice-acceptor site .  This mutation was inferred to cause truncation of the alpha1-subunit molecule and , thereby , a loss of channel function . 
SCN1A_18242854_0	GOF	Functional analysis of this mutation in the backbone of the closely related gene SCN5A demonstrated an increase in persistent current that is similar in magnitude to epileptogenic mutations of SCN1A and SCN2A . 
SCN1A_17565594_1	LOF	We showed that the mutation is associated with a loss of SCN1A function . 
SCN1A_17544618_0	LOF	Furthermore , many SCN1A mutations are predicted to reduce protein levels , emphasizing the importance of precise sodium channel gene regulation . 
SCN1A_17054685_0	LOF	Most SMEI-associated mutations are predicted to truncate the SCN1A protein , likely causing a loss of sodium channel function . 
SCN1A_16210358_2	LOF	In summary , SCN1A mutations associated with ICEGTC result in a wide spectrum of biophysical defects , including mild-to-moderate gating impairments , shifted voltage dependence and reduced use dependence . 
SCN1A_16075041_1	LOF	Many are sporadic mutations and cause loss of function , which demonstrates haploinsufficiency of SCN1A . 
SCN1A_15525788_0	LOF	A mutation in the sodium channel SCN1A was identified in a small Italian family with dominantly inherited generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus ( GEFS+ ) .  The mutation , D1866Y , alters an evolutionarily conserved aspartate residue in the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the sodium channel alpha subunit .  The mutation decreased modulation of the alpha subunit by beta1 , which normally causes a negative shift in the voltage dependence of inactivation in oocytes . 
SCN1A_12821740_5	GOF	The percentage of cases with family history of epilepsy was significantly higher in patients with SCN1A mutations . 
SCN1A_11422459_1	LOF	Functional expression of the SCN1B and one of the SCN1A mutations revealed defects in fast channel inactivation which are in line with previous findings on myotonia causing mutations in SCN4A , the skeletal muscle sodium channel alpha-subunit gene , all showing an impaired fast inactivation . 
CDKL5_30236769_1	LOF	CONCLUSIONS : The impairment of alternative splicing of exon 19 and the lack of a part of the proteasome signal due to c.2788insG mutation could disrupt the dynamic regulation of isoform levels especially hCDKL5_5 and hCDKL5_1 during pre and postnatal neurodevelopment and then could cause pathogenic phenotype . 
CDKL5_29752575_0	LOF	Atypical Rett syndrome is a child neurodevelopmental disorder induced by mutations in CDKL5 gene and characterized by a progressive regression in development with loss of purposeful use of the hands , slowed brain and head growth , problems with walking , seizures , and intellectual disability . 
CDKL5_28674172_0	LOF	These results suggest a novel role for CDKL5 in the regulation of synaptic function and uncover an intriguing microcircuit mechanism underlying impaired learning and memory.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 ( CDKL5 ) deficiency is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the CDKL5 gene . 
CDKL5_22867051_1	LOF	CONCLUSIONS : This study demonstrated the importance of CDKL5 mutations as etiological factors in neurodevelopmental disorders , and indicated that a thorough analysis of the CDKL5 gene sequence and its rearrangements should be considered in females with Rett syndrome-like phenotypes , severe encephalopathy and epilepsy with onset before 5 months of age . 
CDKL5_20397747_2	LOF	These results suggest that pathogenic CDKL5 mutations are unlikely to be identified in the absence of severe early-onset seizures and highlight the importance of screening for large intragenic and whole gene deletions . 
CDKL5_21387820_3	LOF	Genetic testing looking for CDKL5 mutation is indicated in each female child with impaired psychomotor development , refractory epilepsy with early onset polymorphic seizures and clinical _ EEG phenotype of atypical Rett/Angelman syndrome . 
CDKL5_16330482_1	LOF	Finally , the CDKL5 mutations associated with the disease phenotype cause loss of kinase activity as assessed by autophosphorylation . 
STXBP1_29067685_3	LOF	Biochemical analysis showed that unlike the mutation p.W28* , the mutation p.P480L did not affect STXBP1 expression and reduced the interaction of Syn-1A with Kv7 channels . 
STXBP1_29067685_4	LOF	They suggest also that a defect in Kv7 channel activity or regulation could be one of the consequences of some STXBP1 mutations associated with EOEEs . 
STXBP1_28865303_0	LOF	Hence , the review will focus on the mutations that impair GABAergic signaling and selectively discuss the newly identified STXBP1 , PRRT2 , and DNM1 in addition to those long-established epilepsy ion channel genes that also impair GABAergic signaling like SCN1A and GABAA receptor subunit genes . 
STXBP1_27184330_2	LOF	RESULTS : The characteristic feature of our three patients is the lack of epilepsy which is in contrast to the majority of the patients with STXBP1 mutation . 
STXBP1_26514728_0	LOF	OBJECTIVE : Mutations in the syntaxin binding protein 1 gene ( STXBP1 ) have been associated mostly with early onset epileptic encephalopathies ( EOEEs ) and Ohtahara syndrome , with a mutation detection rate of approximately 10 % , depending on the criteria of selection of patients . 
STXBP1_26280581_0	LOF	Heterozygous mutations in the syntaxin-binding protein 1 ( STXBP1 ) gene , which encodes Munc18-1 , a core component of the presynaptic membrane-fusion machinery , cause infantile early epileptic encephalopathy ( Ohtahara syndrome ) , but it is unclear how a partial loss of Munc18-1 produces this severe clinical presentation . 
STXBP1_26280581_2	LOF	We demonstrated that heterozygous STXBP1 mutations lower the levels of Munc18-1 protein and its binding partner , the t-SNARE-protein Syntaxin-1 , by approximately 30 % and decrease spontaneous and evoked neurotransmitter release by nearly 50 % . 
STXBP1_26280581_3	LOF	Thus , our results confirm that using engineered human embryonic stem ( ES ) cells is a viable approach to studying disease-associated mutations in human neurons on a controlled genetic background , demonstrate that partial STXBP1 loss of function robustly impairs neurotransmitter release in human neurons , and suggest that heterozygous STXBP1 mutations cause early epileptic encephalopathy specifically through a presynaptic impairment . 
STXBP1_20876469_3	LOF	All mutations are predicted to abolish STXBP1 function and 5 mutations were proven to occur de novo . 
CACNA1H_20091047_0	GOF	In fact , gain-of-function mutations have been identified in Cav3.2 ( an LVA or T-type calcium channel encoded by the CACNA1H gene ) in patients with congenital forms of IGEs , consistent with increased excitability of neurons as a result of enhanced T-type channel function . 
EFHC1_19147686_0	LOF	These observations seem to further suggest that decrease or loss of function of myoclonin1 may be the molecular basis for epilepsies caused by EFHC1 mutations . 
EFHC1_16876319_1	LOF	Thus , the absence of significant and potentially functional mutations in the remaining 14 genes further supports the concept that Myoclonin1/EFHC1 is the EJM1 gene in chromosome 6p12 . 
EFHC1_15258581_2	GOF	In patch-clamp analysis , EFHC1 specifically increased R-type Ca ( 2+ ) currents that were reversed by the mutations associated with JME . 
CNTNAP2_29028946_1	LOF	We also tested the effects of 4 human CNTNAP2 ASD missense mutations in vivo , and found that they impaired PV+ CIN development . 
CNTNAP2_28588433_0	LOF	A variety of molecular mechanisms , such as loss of transcription factor binding sites and perturbation of penetrance and expressivity , have been proposed to account for the phenotypic variability resulting from CNTNAP2 mutations . 
CNTNAP2_25852443_0	LOF	Those include gene disruption , loss of a gene copy by a heterozygous deletion , altered regulation of gene expression due to loss of transcription factor binding and DNA methylation sites , and mutations in the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein which may provoke altered interactions of the CNTNAP2-encoded protein , Caspr2 , with other proteins . 
CNTNAP2_25852443_1	LOF	In some of these disorders , disruption of CNTNAP2 may be interpreted as a susceptibility factor rather than a directly causative mutation . 
CNTNAP2_18179895_0	LOF	We focused our initial analysis on CNTNAP2 based on our demonstration of disruption of Contactin 4 ( CNTN4 ) in a patient with ASD ; the recent finding of rare homozygous mutations in CNTNAP2 leading to intractable seizures and autism ; and in situ and biochemical analyses reported herein that confirm expression in relevant brain regions and demonstrate the presence of CNTNAP2 in the synaptic plasma membrane fraction of rat forebrain lysates . 
GABRA1_25352779_1	GOF	We further found that the expression of the most severe GABRA1 missense mutation ( a1-A322D ) induced a striking increase of spine density in pyramidal cells along with an increase in the number of mushroom-like spines . 
GABRA1_16718694_2	LOF	INTERPRETATION : We conclude that this de novo mutation can contribute to the cause of `` sporadic '' childhood absence epilepsy by a loss of function and haploinsufficiency of the GABA ( A ) receptor alpha ( 1 ) -subunit , and that GABRA1 mutations rarely are associated with idiopathic generalized epilepsy . 
SCN2A_28254201_0	LOF	SCN2A mutations are associated with epileptic syndromes from benign to extremely severe in absence of such macroscopic brain findings . 
SCN2A_20956790_1	GOF	The patient carries a de novo missense mutation ( p.Ala263Val ) in SCN2A , which leads to a pronounced gain-of-function , in particular an increased persistent Na ( + ) current . 
SCN2A_18242854_0	GOF	Functional analysis of this mutation in the backbone of the closely related gene SCN5A demonstrated an increase in persistent current that is similar in magnitude to epileptogenic mutations of SCN1A and SCN2A . 
LGI1_27760137_4	LOF	This finding likely results from the lack of effects of these mutations on LGI1 protein folding , as suggested by 3D protein modelling . 
LGI1_25485908_2	LOF	Both mutations caused a loss of function , compromising intracellular trafficking or ligand activity of LGI1 and converging on reduced synaptic LGI1-ADAM22 interaction . 
LGI1_22323750_0	LOF	OBJECTIVE : In families with autosomal dominant partial epilepsy with auditory features ( ADPEAF ) with mutations in the LGI1 gene , we evaluated clustering of mutations within the gene and associations of penetrance and phenotypic features with mutation location and predicted effect ( truncation or missense ) . 
LGI1_20659958_0	LOF	While mutations probably result in a loss of function , the role of LGI1 in the pathophysiology of epilepsy remains unclear . 
LGI1_20659151_2	GOF	DISCUSSION : Although LGI1 mutation carriers who were clinically affected with epilepsy had increased depressive symptoms , mutation carriers without epilepsy did not . 
LGI1_20659151_3	GOF	These findings suggest that the increase in depressive symptoms in affected individuals from these families is related to epilepsy or its treatment rather than to LGI1 mutations per se . 
LGI1_16787412_0	GOF	These results suggest that the two protein isoforms encoded by LGI1/Epitempin are differentially expressed in the human brain , and that higher expression levels of these proteins in the lateral temporal cortex may underlie the susceptibility of this brain region to the epileptogenic effects of LGI1/Epitempin mutations . 
SCN1B_20382841_0	LOF	Sequencing of the Sodium channel subunit beta-1 gene ( SCN1B ) ( 19q13.1 ) showed the absence of any causal mutation . 
SCN1B_15857929_0	LOF	Refractoriness and relative refractory period ( markers of transient Na ( + ) channel function ) were significantly reduced in GEFS+ patients with established mutations in SCN1B ( P < 0.05 ) , and strength-duration time constants ( dependent on persistent Na ( + ) conductances ) were reduced .  It is suggested that , in peripheral nerve axons , the mutation underlying GEFS+ reduces the number of functioning Na ( + ) channels at the node of Ranvier and that this rather than any change in gating of individual channels dominates axonal excitability in these patients . 
SCN1B_14504340_1	LOF	In a family with FS+ and early-onset absence epilepsy , a mutation was identified that predicts a deletion of five amino acids in the extracellular immunoglobulin-like domain of SCN1B and potential loss of function . 
SCN1B_11422459_1	LOF	Functional expression of the SCN1B and one of the SCN1A mutations revealed defects in fast channel inactivation which are in line with previous findings on myotonia causing mutations in SCN4A , the skeletal muscle sodium channel alpha-subunit gene , all showing an impaired fast inactivation . 
SCARB2_29941711_1	LOF	Further functional analysis revealed that this mutation led to loss function of the SCARB2 protein . 
SCARB2_22050460_3	LOF	Patients with PME of unknown origin of adolescent or young adult onset , with these neurophysiologic features , should be tested for SCARB2 mutations , even in the absence of renal impairment . 
SCARB2_18424452_1	LOF	Besides lacking immunodetectable LIMP-2 , patient fibroblasts also had decreased amounts of beta-glucocerebrosidase , which was mainly located in the endoplasmic reticulum , as assessed by its sensitivity to Endo H. This is the first report of a mutation in the SCARB2 gene associated with a human disease , which , contrary to earlier proposals , shares no features with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease both at the clinical and neurophysiological levels . 
SCARB2_18308289_0	LOF	Mutations in SCARB2/Limp2 were found in all three families used for mapping and subsequently confirmed in two other unrelated AMRF families .  The mutations were associated with lack of SCARB2 protein . 
CHRNA2_25770198_3	GOF	CONCLUSION : ADNFLE had previously been associated with CHRNA2 dysfunction in one family , in which a gain of function mutation was demonstrated . 
CHRNA2_25770198_4	LOF	We confirm the causative role of CHRNA2 mutations in ADNFLE and demonstrate that also loss of function of a2 nAChRs may have pathogenic effects . 
CHRNA2_17602836_1	LOF	The absence of mutations in our sample of 47 families renders a major role of CHRNA2 in ADNFLE unlikely . 
CASR_27617113_0	GOF	Autosomal dominant hypocalcemia , caused by activating mutations of the calcium-sensing receptor ( CASR ) gene , is characterized by hypocalcemia with an inappropriately low concentration of parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) . 
CASR_20374733_0	GOF	Heterozygous activating mutations of the CASR cause autosomal dominant hypocalcemia ( ADH ) that may be asymptomatic or present with seizures in the neonatal period or childhood or later in life . 
CASR_18370233_0	GOF	The role of inactivating and activating calcium-sensing receptor ( CASR ) mutations is discussed with respect to familial hypocalciuric hypercalemia ( FHH ) and autosomal dominant hypocalemia ( ADH ) . 
CASR_11013439_0	GOF	The disorder autosomal dominant hypocalcemia ( ADH ) is due to gain-of-function mutations in the CASR gene . 
GOSR2_27618868_1	LOF	The functional effect of this mutation is a loss of function that results in failure of the GOSR2 protein to localize to the cis-Golgi . 
GOSR2_21549339_1	LOF	This p.Gly144Trp mutation is equivalent to a loss of function and results in failure of GOSR2 protein to localize to the cis-Golgi . 
WWOX_24932569_1	LOF	Finally , very recently the first human pedigrees with probands carrying homozygous germline loss of function WWOX mutations have been identified . 
WWOX_24369382_1	LOF	We demonstrate that proline 47 is a key amino acid essential for maintaining the WWOX protein fully functional , with its mutation into a threonine resulting in a loss of peptide interaction for the first WW domain . 
SZT2_23932106_1	LOF	Thus , all three mutations are predicted to result in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and/or premature protein truncation and thereby loss of SZT2 function . 
CPA6_27050163_0	LOF	The characterization of these human mutations suggests a dominant mode of inheritance by haploinsufficiency through loss of function mutations , however the total number of humans with pathologic mutations in CPA6 identified to date remains small . 
CPA6_23105115_4	LOF	Several mutations resulted in reduced enzyme activity or CPA6 protein levels in the extracellular matrix . 
CPA6_23105115_5	LOF	The mutants with reduced extracellular CPA6 protein levels showed normal levels of 50-kDa proCPA6 in the cell , and this could be converted into 37-kDa CPA6 by trypsin , suggesting that protein folding was not greatly affected by the mutations . 
CPA6_23105115_6	LOF	Interestingly , three of the mutations that reduced extracellular CPA6 protein levels were found in patients with epilepsy . 
SLC2A1_30271476_0	LOF	Glut-1 transporter deficiency syndrome ( GLUT1-DS ) is a rare disorder caused by the mutation in SLC2A1 gene , which results in impaired glucose transport into the brain .  It has a broad spectrum of phenotypic presentation ranging from cognitive decline , microcephaly , and refractory seizures to complex movement disorder . 
SLC2A1_27927575_0	LOF	Glucose transporter 1 deficiency syndrome ( GLUT1-DS ) is an inborn error of metabolism caused by impaired glucose transport through blood brain barrier due to mutation in SLC2A1 gene , encoding transporter protein . 
SLC2A1_27927575_1	LOF	The absence of pathogenic mutation in SLC2A1 gene does not exclude the diagnosis . 
SLC2A1_26336901_0	LOF	For some time , paediatric neurologists have recognised glucose transporter type 1 ( GluT1 ) deficiency syndrome as a cause of intractable infantile seizures , microcephaly , developmental delay and hypoglycorrhachia in the presence of a normal plasma glucose .  It is caused by mutations in the SLC2A1 gene , coding for GluT1 , leading to a reduction in the available glucose transporter sites ; it responds to the ketogenic diet . 
SLC2A1_25440161_0	LOF	Glucose transporter 1 deficiency syndrome ( OMIM 606777 ) is a treatable epileptic encephalopathy caused by mutations in the SLC2A1 gene ( OMIM 138140 ) causing impaired glucose transport into the brain . 
SLC2A1_25256448_1	LOF	At the age of 35 months , GLUT1-DS was diagnosed based on hypoglycorrhachia with a decreased CSF to blood glucose ratio , and subsequent direct sequencing of the SLC2A1 gene revealed a de novo heterozygous mutation , c.349A > T ( p.Lys117X ) on exon 4 .  It was noteworthy that the patient adapted to the deficient cerebral glucose transport by permanent ketone body production since early life . 
SLC2A1_24032425_1	GOF	Among patients with NP-EOAE , those receiving tritherapy showed increased risk of structural brain abnormalities ( p = 0.001 ) or SLC2A1 mutations ( p = 0.001 ) but fewer myoclonic features ( p = 0.031 ) and worse seizure-free survival curve ( p = 0.047 ) than those treated with mono- and bitherapy . 
SLC2A1_24002817_0	LOF	The facilitative glucose transporter-1 ( GLUT1 ) deficiency or de Vivo syndrome is a rare neuropediatric disorder characterized by drug-resistant epilepsy , acquired microcephaly , delayed psychomotor development , intermittent ataxia , and other paroxysmal neurological disorders due to the presence of dominant mutations in the SLC2A1 gene . 
SLC2A1_22212417_0	LOF	Glucose transporter-1 ( GLUT1 ) deficiency syndrome is caused by heterozygous mutations in the SLC2A1 gene , resulting in impaired glucose transport into the brain .  It is characterized by a low glucose concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid ( hypoglycorrhachia ) in the absence of hypoglycemia , in combination with low to normal lactate in the cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) .  It often results in treatment-resistant infantile epilepsy with progressive developmental disabilities and a complex movement disorder . 
SLC2A1_21832227_0	LOF	RESULTS : We identified causative mutations in SLC2A1 in both families , which were absent in 400 control chromosomes , cosegregated with the affection status , and decreased glucose uptake in functional assays . 
SLC2A1_21791420_1	LOF	We now show that sdCHC is associated with mutations in SLC2A1 that cause both loss of glucose transport and a cation leak , as shown by expression studies in Xenopus oocytes . 
SLC2A1_20129935_0	LOF	Glucose transporter-1 deficiency syndrome is caused by mutations in the SLC2A1 gene in the majority of patients and results in impaired glucose transport into the brain . 
SLC2A1_19049586_0	LOF	The condition is diagnosed by hypoglycorrhachia , impaired glucose uptake into erythrocytes , and heterozygous mutations in the SLC2A1 gene ( OMIM 138140 , gene map locus 1p35-31.3 ) . 
DNM1_28865303_0	LOF	Hence , the review will focus on the mutations that impair GABAergic signaling and selectively discuss the newly identified STXBP1 , PRRT2 , and DNM1 in addition to those long-established epilepsy ion channel genes that also impair GABAergic signaling like SCN1A and GABAA receptor subunit genes . 
DNM1_26611353_2	LOF	Structural consideration of DNM1 mutations revealed that both mutations would destabilize the G domain structure and impair nucleotide binding , dimer formation , and/or GTPase activity of the G domain . 
SCN8A_29574705_0	GOF	Here , we demonstrate the feasibility of a more comprehensive approach using high-throughput screening to identify inhibitors of a gain-of-function mutation in the SCN8A gene associated with severe pediatric epilepsy . 
SCN8A_29574705_2	GOF	Voltage clamp experiments in HEK-293 cells expressing the SCN8A R1872Q mutation demonstrated a leftward shift in sodium channel activation as well as delayed inactivation ; both changes are consistent with a gain-of-function mutation . 
SCN8A_27836728_1	GOF	The data support the view that gain-of-function mutations of SCN8A lead to pathogenic alterations in brain function contributing to encephalopathy . 
SCN8A_27375106_0	GOF	OBJECTIVE : SCN8A encephalopathy ( early infantile epileptic encephalopathy ; EIEE13 ) is caused by gain-of-function mutations resulting in hyperactivity of the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav 1.6 . 
SCN8A_27375106_2	GOF	SIGNIFICANCE : SCN8A - I1327V is a gain-of-function mutation with altered features that are predicted to increase neuronal excitability and seizure susceptibility . 
SCN8A_26252990_0	GOF	Gain-of-function missense mutations in SCN8A are thought to lead to increased firing of excitatory neurons containing Nav1.6 , and therefore to lead to increased seizure susceptibility . 
SCN8A_26252990_2	LOF	Herein , we describe 4 patients with a missense SCN8A mutation and epilepsy who all show a remarkably good response on high doses of phenytoin and loss of seizure control when phenytoin medication was reduced , while side effects were relatively mild . 
SCN8A_26220391_1	LOF	CONCLUSIONS : The combination of a rare missense variant with a de novo mosaic deletion of a large part of the SCN8A gene suggests that other possible mechanisms for SCN8A mutations may cause epilepsy ; loss of function , genetic modifiers and cellular interference may play a role . 
SCN8A_25951352_0	GOF	SCN8A mutations that cause increased channel activity are associated with seizures . 
SCN8A_25239001_2	LOF	CONCLUSION : The new de novo SCN8A mutation is clearly deleterious , resulting in an unstable protein with reduced channel activity . 
SCN8A_25227913_1	GOF	We previously described the heterozygous SCN8A missense mutation p.Asn1768Asp in a child with epileptic encephalopathy that included seizures , ataxia , and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy ( SUDEP ) .  The mutation results in increased persistent sodium current and hyperactivity of transfected neurons . 
SLC9A6_29275387_0	LOF	Loss of function mutations in SLC9A6 gene in children has been associated with Christianson syndrome and autism spectrum disorder . 
SLC9A6_27142213_0	LOF	Christianson syndrome ( OMIM 300243 ) , caused by mutations in the X-linked SLC9A6 gene , is characterized by severe global developmental delay and intellectual disability , developmental regression , epilepsy , microcephaly and impaired ocular movements .  It shares many common features with Angelman syndrome . 
SLC9A6_21964919_0	LOF	Importantly , these findings show that sodium-hydrogen exchanger 6 loss of function in the Slc9a6-targeted mouse model leads to compromise of endosomal-lysosomal function similar to lysosomal disease and to conspicuous neuronal abnormalities in specific brain regions , which in concert could provide a unified explanation for the cellular and clinical phenotypes in humans with SLC9A6 mutations . 
GNAO1_29935962_0	LOF	We report on a 4-year-old girl with a de novo GNAO1 mutation who had neurological findings , including decreased spontaneous movements , hypotonia , and dystonic features . 
GNAO1_29935962_2	GOF	The FoldX calculations showed an increased free-energy change in the active state of the GNAO1 protein , indicating that the E237K mutation destabilizes the active state complexes . 
GNAO1_28747448_2	LOF	RESULTS : Of the 15 clinical GNAO1 mutations studied , 9 show reduced expression and loss of function ( LOF ; < 90 % maximal inhibition ) . 
GNAO1_27068059_0	LOF	We describe the largest series of patients with de novoGNAO1 mutations who have severe chorea , developmental delay , and hypotonia in the absence of epilepsy . 
GNAO1_27068059_2	LOF	CONCLUSIONS : Patients with GNAO1 mutations can present with a severe , progressive movement disorder in the absence of epilepsy . 
CERS1_27618929_0	LOF	Genetic study allowed to identify a homozygous nonsynonymous mutation in CERS1 , the gene encoding ceramide synthase 1 , a transmembrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) , catalyzes the biosynthesis of C18-ceramides .  The mutation decreased C18-ceramide levels . 
DOCK7_24814191_0	LOF	Sanger sequencing confirmed that all three individuals are compound heterozygotes for these truncating mutations in DOCK7 .  These mutations have not been observed in public SNP databases and are predicted to abolish domains critical for DOCK7 function . 
MEF2C_23001426_0	LOF	Up to now , only five-point mutations in the MEF2C gene have been described in patients with severe mental retardation with absent speech , limited walking abilities , epilepsy , and lack of gross malformations . 
MEF2C_23001426_2	LOF	By combining the clinical data of all patients with MEF2C point mutations published so far with the phenotype of our patient , a targeted search for MEF2C mutations could be applied to patients with a severe intellectual deficiency associated with absence of language and hypotonia , strabismus , and epilepsy ( started after 6 months , often well controlled by valproate ) . 
KCNT1_30112700_0	GOF	The most common cause for EIMFS is a gain-of-function mutation in the KCNT1 potassium channel gene , and treatment with the KCNT1 blocker quinidine has been suggested as a rational approach for seizure control in EIMFS patients . 
KCNT1_29196578_0	GOF	OBJECTIVE : To evaluate quinidine as a precision therapy for severe epilepsy due to gain of function mutations in the potassium channel gene KCNT1 . 
KCNT1_29196578_2	GOF	CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE : This study provides Class II evidence that for persons with severe epilepsy due to gain of function mutations in the potassium channel gene KCNT1 , quinidine does not significantly reduce seizure frequency . 
KCNT1_26784557_1	GOF	This latter result suggests two genotype-tailored pharmacological strategies to specifically counteract the dysfunction of KCNT1 activating mutations in MMPSI patients . 
KCNT1_26740507_2	GOF	Notably , all mutations in KCNT1 described to date are missense mutations , and electrophysiological studies have shown that they result in increased potassium current . 
KCNT1_25042079_0	GOF	The most common cause is a gain of function mutation in the potassium channel KCNT1 . 
KCNT1_25042079_1	GOF	We report the case of a child with migrating partial seizures of infancy secondary to an activating mutation in KCNT1 treated with quinidine .

KCNT1_24591078_1	GOF	RESULTS : We demonstrate that KCNT1 mutations implicated in epilepsy cause a marked increase in function . 
KCNT1_23086397_2	GOF	Functional studies showed that the mutations led to constitutive activation of the channel , mimicking the effects of phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain by protein kinase C. In addition to regulating ion flux , KCNT1 has a non-conducting function , as its C terminus interacts with cytoplasmic proteins involved in developmental signaling pathways . 
KCNA2_29050392_0	LOF	Recently , de novo mutations in the gene KCNA2 , causing either a dominant-negative loss-of-function or a gain-of-function of the voltage-gated K+ channel Kv1.2 , were described to cause a new molecular entity within the epileptic encephalopathies . 
CSTB_17003839_2	LOF	Expression of CSTB mRNA and protein was markedly reduced in lymphoblastoid cells of the patients irrespective of the mutation type . 
CSTB_15483648_1	LOF	A minisatellite repeat expansion in the promoter region of the CSTB gene is the most common mutation in EPM1 patients and leads to reduced mRNA levels . 
CSTB_14526183_2	LOF	Loss of CSTB function due to mutations is consistent with the observed neurodegenerative pathology and phenotype , but the functional link to the epileptic phenotype of EPM1 remains largely unknown . 
CSTB_10792446_0	LOF	Loss of function mutations in the gene encoding the cysteine protease inhibitor , cystatin B ( CSTB ) , are responsible for the primary defect in human progressive myoclonus epilepsy ( EPM1 ) . 
CSTB_10721698_0	LOF	Northern analysis of lymphoblastoid RNA from individuals with 'premutation ' length dodecamer repeat ( 12-17 copies ) expansions showed decreased levels of CSTB mRNA expression . 
AARS_28493438_2	LOF	A lymphoblastoid cell line developed from one of the affected individuals showed a strong reduction in AARS abundance .  The mutations decrease aminoacylation efficiency by 70 % -90 % . 
ROGDI_29153277_1	LOF	RESULTS : Genetic analysis identified a novel homozygous nonsense mutation in exon 6 of the ROGDI gene ; the mutation caused premature termination of ROGDI translation , resulting in truncation and loss of function of the ROGDI protein . 
ROGDI_27600704_2	LOF	METHODS : In the present cohort study , nine individuals from four families with the clinical diagnosis of KTZS and absence of ROGDI mutations as well as one patient with unexplained epileptic encephalopathy were investigated by clinical and dental evaluation , parametric linkage analysis ( one family ) , and exome and/or Sanger sequencing . 
ROGDI_25565929_1	LOF	By genetic analysis , we identified a novel ROGDI homozygous mutation NM_024589.1 : c.117+1G > T [ Chr16 ( GRCh37 ) : g.4852382C > A ] which confirmed the diagnosis of Kohlsch tter-T nz syndrome .  The mutation abolishes the usual splice donor site of intron 2 which leads to the deletion of exon 2 and in-frame assembly of exon 3 . 
ROGDI_25284547_1	LOF	CONCLUSION : Early onset of seizures and lack of the ability to walk without support may be signs of non-ROGDI mutations in Kohlsch tter-T nz syndrome patients . 
EPM2A_21742036_0	LOF	Lafora disease ( LD ) is the inherited progressive myoclonus epilepsy caused by mutations in either EPM2A gene , encoding the protein phosphatase laforin or the NHLRC1 gene , encoding the ubiquitin ligase malin . 
EPM2A_14532330_0	LOF	The majority of the EPM2A missense mutations found in LD patients result in lack of phosphatase activity , absence of binding to glycogen and lack of interaction with R5 . 
KCNQ3_25524373_2	LOF	Electrophysiological studies in mammalian cells revealed that incorporation of KCNQ3 R330L mutant subunits impaired channel function , suggesting a pathogenetic role for such mutation . 
KCNQ3_24555524_0	LOF	BACKGROUND : KCNQx genes encode slowly activating-inactivating K+ channels , are linked to physiological signal transduction pathways , and mutations in them underlie diseases such as long QT syndrome ( KCNQ1 ) , epilepsy in adults ( KCNQ2/3 ) , benign familial neonatal convulsions in children ( KCNQ3 ) , and hearing loss or tinnitus in humans ( KCNQ4 , but not KCNQ5 ) . 
KCNQ3_18249525_1	LOF	By limited linkage analysis and mutation analysis of KCNQ3 in a Chinese family with BFNC , we identified a novel missense mutation of KCNQ3 , c.988C > T located within exon 6. c.988C > T led to the substitution Cys for Arg in amino acid position 330 ( p.R330C ) in KCNQ3 potassium channel , which possibly impaired the neuronal M-current and altered neuronal excitability . 
KCNQ3_16735477_0	LOF	We further show that several BFNC mutations of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 disrupt surface expression or polarized surface distribution of KCNQ channels , thereby revealing impaired targeting of KCNQ channels to axonal surfaces as a BFNC etiology . 
KCNQ3_14534157_1	LOF	In the Xenopus oocyte expression system , we characterize five KCNQ2 and one KCNQ3 disease-causing mutations .  These mutations cause a variable loss of function , and selective effects on the biophysical properties of KCNQ2/KCNQ3 heteromultimeric channels . 
KCNQ3_11784811_0	LOF	Here we show that KCNQ2/KCNQ3 channels carrying a novel BFNC-causing mutation leading to an arginine to tryptophan substitution in the voltage-sensing S4 domain of KCNQ2 subunits ( R214W ) displayed slower opening and faster closing kinetics and a decreased voltage sensitivity with no concomitant changes in maximal current or plasma membrane expression . 
GRIN2A_24839611_0	GOF	RESULTS : A de novo GRIN2A missense mutation ( c.2434C > A ; p.L812M ) increased the charge transfer mediated by NMDA receptors containing the mutant GluN2A-L812M subunit . 
TBC1D24_28707022_0	LOF	Furthermore , with an increasing number of pathogenic mutations leading to epilepsy and hearing loss being discovered in the TLDc protein TBC1D24 , understanding the function of this family has important implications for a range of inherited neurological diseases . 
TBC1D24_20727515_1	GOF	TBC1D24 overexpression resulted in a significant increase in neurite length and arborization and the FIME mutations significantly reverted this phenotype . 
KCNJ11_29058186_0	LOF	Genetic mutations in KCNJ11 or ABCC8 which encode Kir6.2 and SUR1 respectively are major causes of insulin secretion disorders : those causing loss of channel function lead to congenital hyperinsulinism , whereas those causing gain of channel function result in neonatal diabetes and in some cases developmental delay , epilepsy , and neonatal diabetes , referred to as the DEND syndrome . 
KCNJ11_23776849_0	LOF	Loss of function mutations in ABCC8/KCNJ11 lead to the most severe forms of CHI which are usually medically unresponsive . 
KCNJ11_23462667_0	GOF	OBJECTIVE : Activating mutations in the KCNJ11 gene , encoding the Kir6.2 subunit of the KATP channel , result in permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus . 
KCNJ11_20301549_3	LOF	The focal form of FHI ( pancreatic adenomatous hyperplasia that involves a limited region of the pancreas ) , caused by biallelic mutations of ABCC8 or KCNJ11 , is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner , but only manifests when the mutation occurs on the paternally derived allele and a somatic event results in the loss of the maternal allele in a beta cell precursor . 
KCNJ11_22231386_0	LOF	The most severe forms of HH are due to loss of function mutations in ABCC8/KCNJ11 which encode the SUR1 and KIR6.2 components respectively of the pancreatic b-cell K ( ATP ) channel . 
KCNJ11_22145471_0	GOF	Heterozygous activating mutations in the KCNJ11 gene can cause permanent and transient neonatal diabetes . 
KCNJ11_17923772_0	GOF	Several studies have reported activating mutations in the KCNJ11 gene , encoding the Kir6.2 subunit of the pancreatic KATP channel , in patients with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus for 30-50 % of the cases .  These mutations result in reduced ATP sensitivity of the KATP channels compared with the wild types . 
KCNJ11_17652641_0	GOF	OBJECTIVES : Activating mutations in the human KCNJ11 gene , encoding the pore-forming subunit ( Kir6.2 ) of the ATP-sensitive potassium ( K ( ATP ) ) channel , are one cause of neonatal diabetes mellitus . 
KCNJ11_17635943_3	GOF	Comparing the 6q24 abnormality and KCNJ11 mutation , there were some significant clinical differences : the earlier onset of diabetes , the lower frequency of diabetic ketoacidosis at onset , and the higher proportion of the patients with macroglossia at initial presentation in the patients with 6q24 abnormality . 
KCNJ11_16670688_0	GOF	Heterozygous activating mutations in the gene encoding for the ATP-sensitive potassium channel subunit Kir6.2 ( KCNJ11 ) have recently been shown to be a common cause of permanent neonatal diabetes . 
KCNJ11_16613899_0	GOF	Heterozygous activating mutations in the KCNJ11 gene encoding Kir6.2 , the pore-forming subunit of the ATP-sensitive potassium ( K ( ATP ) ) channel , are the most common cause of permanent neonatal diabetes . 
KCNJ11_16609879_0	GOF	AIMS/HYPOTHESIS : Heterozygous activating mutations in KCNJ11 , which encodes the Kir6.2 subunit of the pancreatic ATP-sensitive potassium ( K ( ATP ) ) channel , cause both permanent and transient neonatal diabetes . 
KCNJ11_16375017_0	GOF	Recently , activating mutations in the KCNJ11 gene , which encodes the Kir6.2 subunit of the K ( ATP ) channel , have been identified as a cause of TNDM , the main cause of PNDM , and the cause of a new syndrome : developmental delay , epilepsy and neonatal diabetes . 
KCNJ11_16019717_0	GOF	Recently , activating mutations in the KCNJ11 gene which encodes the Kir6.2 subunit of the KATP channels in the pancreatic beta-cells were found to be an important cause of PNDM . 
KCNJ11_15115830_0	GOF	Because ATP-sensitive potassium ( K ( ATP ) ) channels mediate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from the pancreatic beta cells , we hypothesized that activating mutations in the gene encoding the Kir6.2 subunit of this channel ( KCNJ11 ) cause neonatal diabetes . 
ABCC8_29058186_0	LOF	Genetic mutations in KCNJ11 or ABCC8 which encode Kir6.2 and SUR1 respectively are major causes of insulin secretion disorders : those causing loss of channel function lead to congenital hyperinsulinism , whereas those causing gain of channel function result in neonatal diabetes and in some cases developmental delay , epilepsy , and neonatal diabetes , referred to as the DEND syndrome . 
ABCC8_23776849_0	LOF	Loss of function mutations in ABCC8/KCNJ11 lead to the most severe forms of CHI which are usually medically unresponsive . 
ABCC8_23430910_0	LOF	Homozygous loss of function mutations in ABCC8 and GALK1 were found , which explained the patient 's CHI and galactokinase deficiency , respectively . 
ABCC8_20301549_5	LOF	The focal form of FHI ( pancreatic adenomatous hyperplasia that involves a limited region of the pancreas ) , caused by biallelic mutations of ABCC8 or KCNJ11 , is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner , but only manifests when the mutation occurs on the paternally derived allele and a somatic event results in the loss of the maternal allele in a beta cell precursor . 
ABCC8_22231386_0	LOF	The most severe forms of HH are due to loss of function mutations in ABCC8/KCNJ11 which encode the SUR1 and KIR6.2 components respectively of the pancreatic b-cell K ( ATP ) channel . 
ABCC8_16613899_0	GOF	We therefore hypothesized that activating mutations in the ABCC8 gene , which encodes SUR1 , might cause neonatal diabetes . 
POLG_25786813_0	LOF	While complex IV expression is more variable , there is reduced expression in patients harbouring m.8344A > G point mutations and POLG mutations . 
POLG_25605636_1	LOF	Furthermore , POLG mutation cells show reduced POLG expression , mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) amount , mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate production , as well as abnormal mitochondrial ultrastructure after differentiation to hepatocyte-like cells . 
POLG_24331360_0	LOF	Also , POLG mutations ( eg , p.T851 A , p.N468D , p.Y831C , p.G517V , and p.P163S ) can cause disease through impaired replication of mtDNA , including migraine . 
POLG_23448099_5	GOF	This study emphasizes that genetic testing for POLG mutations in patients with nonsyndromic intractable epilepsies is very important for clinical diagnostics , genetic counseling , and treatment decisions because of the increased risk for VPA-induced liver failure in patients with POLG mutations . 
POLG_22647225_0	LOF	As a consequence , POLG mutations can cause disease through impaired replication of mitochondrial DNA . 
POLG_22237560_4	LOF	The phenotype is different depending on the presence or absence of POLG1 mutations . 
POLG_21967349_0	LOF	We have studied two types of mitochondrial disease : one arising from a defect in mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) ( MELAS ) and one due to a nuclear gene mutation ( POLG ) . 
POLG_18504129_0	LOF	Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome ( MDS ) is characterized by a reduction in mtDNA copy number and has been associated with mutations in eight nuclear genes , including enzymes involved in mitochondrial nucleotide metabolism ( POLG , TK2 , DGUOK , SUCLA2 , SUCLG1 , PEO1 ) and MPV17 . 
POLG_16024923_2	LOF	We propose that reduced polymerase activity and loss of accessory subunit interaction are responsible for the depletion and deletion of mitochondrial DNA observed in patients with this POLG mutation . 
PNPO_24645144_0	LOF	Three groups of patients with PNPO mutations that had reduced enzyme activity were identified : ( i ) patients with neonatal onset seizures responding to pyridoxal 5'-phosphate ( n = 6 ) ; ( ii ) a patient with infantile spasms ( onset 5 months ) responsive to pyridoxal 5'-phosphate ( n = 1 ) ; and ( iii ) patients with seizures starting under 3 months of age responding to pyridoxine ( n = 8 ) . 
KCNJ10_29666984_2	LOF	CONCLUSION : The present cases harboring novel homozygous frameshift mutations in KCNJ10 expand the spectrum of brain abnormalities in EAST syndrome , including mild cerebellar atrophy and intramyelinic edema , resulting from abnormal function of the Kir4.1 inwardly rectifying potassium channel at the astrocyte endfeet , with disruption of water-ion homeostasis . 
KCNJ10_28747464_2	LOF	Wild-type KCNJ10 expression yielded robust Kir current , whereas currents from oocytes expressing the mutation were reduced , remarkably . 
KCNJ10_28747464_3	LOF	We thus report a novel loss-of-function mutation in Kir4.1 found in a patient with a coexisting mutation in SLACK channels that results in a fatal disease.NEW _ NOTEWORTHY We present and characterize a novel mutation in KCNJ10 Unlike previously reported EAST/SeSAME patients , our patient was heterozygous , and contrary to previous studies , mimicking the heterozygous state by coexpression resulted in loss of channel function . 
KCNJ10_20651251_2	LOF	In summary , EAST mutations of KCNJ10 lead to impaired channel function and structural changes in distal convoluted tubules . 
KCNJ10_20651251_3	LOF	Intriguingly , the metabolic alkalosis present in patients carrying the R65P mutation possibly improves residual function of KCNJ10 , which shows higher activity at alkaline pH . 
CACNA1A_29366381_0	LOF	Patient Description : The authors describe a female patient with developmental regression and a de novo , likely pathogenic mutation in CACNA1A who meets 3 of 4 main criteria ( stereotypic hand movements , loss of purposeful hand movements , gait disturbance ) , and 6 of 11 supportive criteria ( impaired sleep , abnormal tone , vasomotor disturbance , scoliosis , growth retardation , and screaming spells ) for atypical Rett syndrome .

CACNA1A_21490217_0	GOF	Familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 , a monogenic migraine variant with aura , is linked to gain-of-function mutations in the CACNA1A gene encoding Ca ( V ) 2.1 channels . 
CACNA1A_15907261_0	GOF	The increased number of mutations in the FHM1 ( CACNA1A ) and the FHM2 ( ATP1A2 ) genes allow studying the relationship between genetic findings in both genes and the clinical features in patients . 
CACNA1A_11564488_0	LOF	FINDINGS : We identified a previously undescribed heterozygous point mutation ( C5733T ) in CACNA1A .  This mutation introduces a premature stop codon ( R1820stop ) resulting in complete loss of the C terminal region of the pore-forming subunit of this Ca ( 2+ ) channel . 
ASAH1_28072961_1	LOF	Result : The girl , 2 years 2 months old , was sent to our hospital in October 2015 , with complains of `` joint swelling for 17 months , development regress of intelligence and movement for 11 months , intermittent seizures for 2 months '' .The clinical manifestation of the patient was characterized by painful and deformed joints , subcutaneous nodules , progressive hoarseness , and the progressive neurological system deterioration.Joints swelling and deformity behave as the first symptoms.A series of electroencephalogram showed slow background and spike wave.Visual evoked potential was significantly abnormal.Brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) showed hypomyelination and progressive diffuse brain atrophy.Histology of subcutaneous nodule showed proliferation of the connective tissue with hyalinization , cholesterol crystal like changes , and a large number of foamy cell infiltration.Compound heterozygous mutations of ASAH1 gene , c. 304_305 ins A ( p.T102Nfs14 ) and c. 314T > C ( p.L105p ) , were found in the patient , and the former is inherited from her mother , the latter from her father.Antiepileptic treatment and other symptomatic treatments were delivered to the patient , but the effectiveness was poor.One reference from China hownet and 35 references from Pubmed have reported a total of 26 cases.Twenty out of 26 patients ( 77 % ) had the onset under 1 year of age.By region , there were 12 patients ( 12/26 , 46 % ) from India , and the others around world.Among these 12 indian patients , 10 lack of complete clinical data.Among the rest 16 patients , 4 patients ' parents were consanguineous ; 8 patients with the main clinical manifestation of painful and deformed joints , subcutaneous nodules , and hoarse cry ; 4 patients with hepatic failure and impaired spleen ; 5 patients with rapid neurological deterioration ; 1 patient with bone destruction ; 7 patients under liver and skin biopsies , pathologically showing a large number of foam cells and `` Farber bodies '' .

PRDM8_22961547_1	GOF	We find that Phe261Leu-PRDM8 results in excessive sequestration of laforin and malin in the nucleus and that it therefore likely represents a gain-of-function mutation that leads to an effective deficiency of cytoplasmic laforin and malin . 
PIGA_26923721_0	LOF	The functional effect of this PIGA mutation was assessed by the surface expression levels of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins on blood cells : CD16 on red blood cells was significantly decreased in the proband ( by 11.0 % ) and his mother ( by 15.6 % ) . 
PIGA_24259288_3	LOF	In conclusion , the PIGA mutation in this family likely causes a reduction in GPI anchor protein cell surface expression in various cell types , resulting in the observed pleiotropic phenotype involving central nervous system , skin , and iron metabolism . 
PIGA_24259184_0	GOF	Here , we report the first germline missense mutation in the PIGA gene associated with accelerated linear growth , obesity , central hypotonia , severe refractory epilepsy , cardiac anomalies , mild facial dysmorphic features , mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase levels , and CNS anomalies consisting of progressive cerebral atrophy , insufficient myelinization , and cortical MRI signal abnormalities .

ZEB2_24715670_0	LOF	Mowat-Wilson syndrome ( MWS ) is a multiple congenital anomaly syndrome characterized by moderate or severe intellectual disability , a characteristic facial appearance , microcephaly , epilepsy , agenesis or hypoplasia of the corpus callosum , congenital heart defects , Hirschsprung disease , and urogenital/renal anomalies .  It is caused by de novo heterozygous loss of function mutations including nonsense mutations , frameshift mutations , and deletions in ZEB2 at 2q22 . 
ZEB2_23466526_4	LOF	Our data provide evidence that these missense mutations cause a partial loss of function of ZEB2 , suggesting that its role is not restricted to repression of E-cadherin . 
ZEB2_23466526_5	LOF	Finally , these findings broaden the clinical spectrum of ZEB2 mutations , indicating that MWS ought to be considered in patients with lesser degrees of ID and a suggestive facial gestalt , even in the absence of congenital malformation .

SV2A_27265781_2	LOF	The present results demonstrate that dysfunction of SV2A due to the Sv2a ( L174Q ) mutation impairs the synaptic GABA release by reducing the Syt1 level and facilitates the kindling development , illustrating the crucial role of SV2A-GABA system in modulating kindling epileptogenesis . 
FOXG1_19772934_0	LOF	Microdeletions at 14q12 that include FOXG1 , or loss of function mutations in FOXG1 , are associated with the congenital variant of Rett syndrome . 
TSC2_30144504_1	LOF	Together these data suggest that heterozygous TSC2 mutations disrupt neuronal development , potentially contributing to the disease neuropathology , and that this defect may result from dysregulated PI3K/AKT signaling in neural progenitor cells .

TSC2_25613864_1	LOF	Mechanistically , TSC1 and TSC2 loss of function mutations result in abnormally high mTORC1 activity . 
TSC2_25432535_1	LOF	Targeted , next-generation sequencing ( NGS ) analysis of TSC2 in five tumors ( four from the left kidney , one from the right ) showed loss of heterozygosity in one tumor , and four different TSC2 point mutations ( p.E1351* , p.R1032* , p.R1713H , c.4178_4179delCT ) in the other four samples . 
TSC2_23485365_0	GOF	TSC is caused by inactivating mutations in one of two genes , TSC1 and TSC2 , resulting in increased activity of the mammalian Target of Rapamycin ( mTOR ) . 
TSC2_22867869_1	LOF	However , missense mutations located in the central region of TSC2 ( exons 23-33 ) were associated with a significantly reduced incidence of IS .

TSC2_19028034_0	GOF	Tuberous Sclerosis Complex ( TSC ) is a multisystem genetic disorder with variable phenotypic expression , due to a mutation in one of the two genes , TSC1 and TSC2 , and a subsequent hyperactivation of the downstream mTOR pathway , resulting in increased cell growth and proliferation . 
TSC2_16417883_0	GOF	The TSC2 gene mutation was associated with a significant increase in the tuber count per lobe and in total ( P < .01 ) . 
TSC2_16417883_1	GOF	In summary , increased tuber count is strongly associated with infantile spasms and a TSC2 gene mutation . 
TSC2_16114042_4	LOF	For the missense mutations , we established a functional assay to demonstrate that the mutations impair TSC2 protein function . 
TSC2_11112665_6	LOF	The reduced severity of disease in patients without defined mutations suggests that many of these patients are mosaic for a TSC2 mutation and/or have TSC because of mutations in an as-yet-unidentified locus with a relatively mild clinical phenotype . 
ELOVL4_29168048_0	LOF	Homozygous mutations in ELOVL4 cause severe neuropathology in humans ( Ozaki et al. , JAMA Neurol 72 ( 7 ) : 797-805 , 2015 ; Mir et al. , BMC Med Genet 15 : 25 , 2014 ; Cadieux-Dion et al. , JAMA Neurol 71 ( 4 ) : 470-475 , 2014 ; Bourassa et al. , JAMA Neurol 72 ( 8 ) : 942-943 , 2015 ; Aldahmesh et al. , Am J Hum Genet 89 ( 6 ) : 745-750 , 2011 ) and are post-natal lethal in mice ( Cameron et al. , Int J Biol Sci 3 ( 2 ) : 111-119 , 2007 ; Li et al. , Int J Biol Sci 3 ( 2 ) : 120-128 , 2007 ; McMahon et al. , Molecular Vision 13 : 258-272 , 2007 ; Vasireddy et al. , Hum Mol Genet 16 ( 5 ) : 471-482 , 2007 ) from dehydration due to loss of VLC-SFA that comprise the skin permeability barrier . 
CYP2C9_18040121_0	LOF	The PCR-RFLP analysis revealed a homozygosity involving CYP2C9*3*3 .  This mutation results in a marked decrease in the enzymatic activity ( CYP2C9 ) and leads to a decreased clearance of the drug which can lead to severe acute and chronic toxicity . 
CYP2C9_11673755_0	LOF	In the absence of any acquired predisposing factor for phenytoin toxicity , genetic mutations in the cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) enzymes responsible for phenytoin metabolism ( CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 ) were suspected . 
CYP2C9_11673755_1	LOF	In view of the markedly reduced metabolic activity of CYP2C*3 in comparison with the wild-type enzyme ( about one fifth ) and of the minor role of CYP2C19 in phenytoin metabolism , it is likely that CYP2C9*3 mutation was largely responsible for drug overdose . 
CYP2C9_9860067_2	LOF	CONCLUSIONS : Although the hydroxylation capacity of PHT was impaired with mutations of CYP2C9/19 , the impairment was greater for CYP2C9 . 
CYP2C9_9333104_0	LOF	CONCLUSION : The findings indicated that the genetic polymorphisms of CYP2C isozymes play an important role in the pharmacokinetic variability of phenytoin and that the mutation in CYP2C9 proteins ( Ile359 -- > Leu ) is a determinant of impaired metabolism of the drug among Japanese persons . 
CYP2C9_8874828_1	LOF	These findings suggested that the genetic polymorphism of CYP2C isoenzymes plays an important role in the pharmacokinetic variability of phenytoin , and that the mutation in CYP2C9 proteins is a determinant of impaired metabolism of the drug . 
HCN2_29466436_0	LOF	Here , we characterize a novel , 3kb insertion mutation of Hcn2 in the Tremor and Reduced Lifespan 2 ( TRLS/2J ) mouse that leads to complete loss of HCN2 protein , and we show that this mutation causes many phenotypes similar to other mice lacking HCN2 expression . 
HCN2_29466436_1	LOF	In summary , a novel mutation in HCN2 likely leads to impaired GI motility , causing the severe growth restriction seen in mice with mutations that eliminate HCN2 expression . 
PRNP_20301407_2	LOF	Sequence analysis of PRNP may not detect all disease-causing mutations ; thus , the absence of a PRNP disease-causing mutation does not rule out the diagnosis of genetic human prion disease . 
MTHFR_23749819_0	LOF	MTHFR C677T mutation is considered a prothrombotic factor ; however , in the absence of hyperhomocysteinaemia , no direct therapeutic approach is necessary .

IDH1_29404978_1	GOF	Low-grade gliomas ( WHO II/III ) had lower xCT expression than glioblastoma ( p = 0.001 ) , and tumors without IDH1 R132H mutation tended to have higher xCT levels ( p = 0.07 ) . 
IDH1_27821299_0	LOF	Genetic biomarkers such as isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 ( IDH1 ) mutations , low expression of excitatory amino acid transporter 2 ( EAAT2 ) , high xCT expression , overexpression of adenosine kinase ( ADK ) and low expression of very large G-protein-coupled receptor-1 ( VLGR1 ) are primarily involved in synaptic transmission , whereas BRAF mutations , epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) amplification , miR-196b expression and low ki-67 expression are associated with regulation of cell proliferation . 
IDH1_24903073_4	GOF	RESULTS : The percentage of cells positive for the IDH1-R132H mutation was found to be higher in patients with TAE compared to those without TAE ( median and interquartile range ( IQR ) 25.3 % [ 8.6-53.5 ] vs. 5.2 % [ 0.6-13.4 ] , p = 0.03 ) .

The mutation , affecting the last nucleotide of intron 1 , leads to aberrant splicing , a frame-shift in the highly conserved exon 2 , and decreased amount of the COX8A transcript . 
COX8A_26685157_1	LOF	The loss of the wild-type COX8A protein severely impairs the stability of the entire cytochrome c oxidase enzyme complex and manifests in isolated complex IV deficiency in skeletal muscle and fibroblasts , similar to the frequent c.845_846delCT mutation in the assembly factor SURF1 gene . 
ADK_27821299_0	LOF	Genetic biomarkers such as isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 ( IDH1 ) mutations , low expression of excitatory amino acid transporter 2 ( EAAT2 ) , high xCT expression , overexpression of adenosine kinase ( ADK ) and low expression of very large G-protein-coupled receptor-1 ( VLGR1 ) are primarily involved in synaptic transmission , whereas BRAF mutations , epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) amplification , miR-196b expression and low ki-67 expression are associated with regulation of cell proliferation .

BACE1_23595759_0	LOF	Such a finding would be of interest because of its potential impact on neuronal activity : previous studies demonstrated that BACE1-overexpressing mice exhibit excessive cleavage of Navb2 and reduced sodium current density , but the phenotype associated with loss of function mutations in either Navb-subunits or pore-forming a-subunits is epilepsy . 
PSEN1_27466472_3	GOF	Among all PSEN1 mutations , those within the domains of protein hydrophilic I , transmembrane II ( TM-II ) , TM-III , TM-IV , and TM-VII were associated with a significant increase in seizure frequency compared to other domains ( HR = 4.53 [ 1.93-10.65 ] , p = 0.0005 ) .

GAMT_16899382_1	GOF	Here , we prove that mutations in the GAMT gene are responsible for GAMT deficiency , since overexpression of the GAMT open reading frame restores GAMT activity in GAMT-deficient fibroblasts . 
ALPL_20301329_0	LOF	DIAGNOSIS/TESTING : Although formal diagnostic criteria are not established , all forms of hypophosphatasia ( except pseudohypophosphatasia ) share in common reduced activity of unfractionated serum alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) and presence of either one or two pathologic mutations in ALPL , the gene encoding alkaline phosphatase , tissue-nonspecific isozyme ( TNSALP ) .

ATP1A3_25656163_2	LOF	We demonstrate in both control human brain tissue and that from the subject with the p.Gly358Val mutation that ATP1A3 immunofluorescence is prominently associated with interneurons in the cortex , which may provide some insight into the pathogenesis of the disease . 
ARHGEF15_23647072_0	LOF	In vitro analyses using cell-based assays revealed that the CLCN4 mutation greatly impaired ion transport by the ClC-4 2Cl ( - ) /H ( + ) -exchanger and that the mutation in ARHGEF15 reduced GEF exchange activity of the gene product , Ephexin5 , by about 50 % . 
PHGDH_11751922_0	LOF	While others have proposed that the V490M mutation decreases the V ( max ) of the enzyme , we conclude that this mutation impairs the folding and/or assembly of PHGDH but has minimal effects on the activity or stability of that portion of the V490M mutant that reaches a mature conformation .

FMR1_29325626_3	GOF	In fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome , a toxic gain of function is postulated with the production of excess CGG repeat-containing FMR1 mRNA , abnormal translation of the repeat sequence leading to production of polyglycine , polyalanine , and other polypeptides and to outright deficits in translation leading to reduced FMRP at larger premutation sizes . 
FMR1_25278957_0	LOF	Expansions of more than 200 CGG repeats ( full mutation ) in the FMR1 gene give rise to fragile X syndrome ( FXS ) through a process that generally involves hypermethylation of the FMR1 promoter region and gene silencing , resulting in absence of expression of the encoded protein , FMRP . 
FMR1_25258535_0	LOF	Fragile X syndrome ( FXS ) is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability and the most common single-gene cause of autism .  It is caused by mutations on the fragile X mental retardation gene ( FMR1 ) and lack of fragile X mental retardation protein , which in turn , leads to decreased inhibition of translation of many synaptic proteins .

IQSEC2_30255931_0	GOF	Furthermore , two patients on VPA polytherapy developed acute pancreatitis , and two pediatric patients with heterozygous p.Q1236H variants and mutations in IQSEC2 and GLDC , respectively , had elevated levels of VPA metabolites in urine , elevated plasma glycine , and/or increased acylglycine excretion . 
IQSEC2_28463240_1	LOF	Although IQ and Sec7 domain mutations lead to partial loss of IQSEC2 enzymatic activity , the in vivo pathogenesis resulting from these mutations is not known . 
FA2H_20104589_1	LOF	Measurement of enzyme activity in vitro revealed significantly reduced enzymatic function of FA2H associated with these mutations . 
DEAF1_26048982_0	LOF	RESULTS : We found an autosomal recessive splice acceptor mutation in DEAF1 ( c.997+4A > C , p.G292Pfs* ) in all affected individuals , which led to exon skipping , and reduced the normal full-length mRNA copy number in the patients to 5 % of the wild-type level . 
CIC_24687295_0	LOF	Impaired function of the mitochondrial citrate carrier ( CIC ) due to pathogenic mutations within the SLC25A1 gene has been identified as the underlying molecular cause of the disease . 
ZBTB18_24193349_2	LOF	Incomplete penetrance or haploinsufficiency of other genes from the critical region may explain the absence of corpus callosum agenesis in this patient with a ZBTB18 point mutation . 
GLDC_30255931_0	GOF	Furthermore , two patients on VPA polytherapy developed acute pancreatitis , and two pediatric patients with heterozygous p.Q1236H variants and mutations in IQSEC2 and GLDC , respectively , had elevated levels of VPA metabolites in urine , elevated plasma glycine , and/or increased acylglycine excretion . 
DDHD2_26113134_0	LOF	Exome sequencing identified a homozygous stop gain mutation ( pR287X ) in the phospholipase A1 gene DDHD2 , in the affected individuals , resulting in a premature stop codon and a severely truncated protein lacking the SAM and DDHD domains crucial for phosphoinositide binding and phospholipase activity . 
PRIMA1_26339676_3	LOF	PRiMA knockout mice have reduction of AChE and accumulation of acetylcholine at the synapse ; our minigene analysis suggests that the c.93+2T > C mutation leads to knockout of PRIMA1 . 
PRIMA1_26339676_4	LOF	Thus , enhanced cholinergic responses are the likely cause of the severe NFLE and intellectual disability segregating in this family , representing the first recessive case to be reported and the first PRIMA1 mutation implicated in disease . 
STK11_24260271_0	GOF	BACKGROUND : Peutz-Jeghers syndrome ( PJS ) is characterized by intestinal polyposis , mucocutaneous pigmentation and an increased cancer risk , usually caused by mutations of the STK11 gene . 
PGK1_26883264_1	LOF	Analysis of the effect of this mutation on pre-mRNA processing demonstrated markedly decreased levels of normal PGK1 mRNA . 
NPC1_22572546_0	LOF	Niemann-Pick disease type C ( NP-C ) is a rare inherited neurovisceral disease caused by mutations in either the NPC1 ( in 95 % of cases ) or the NPC2 gene ( in around 5 % of cases ) , which lead to impaired intracellular lipid trafficking and accumulation of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids in the brain and other tissues . 
NPRL3_26786403_1	LOF	The absence of apparent structural brain abnormalities suggests that mutations in NPRL3 are not necessarily associated with focal cortical dysplasia but might be able to cause epilepsy by different , yet unknown pathomechanisms . 
MT-ATP6_29481804_1	LOF	The result of mutational analysis revealed the absence of mitochondrial mutations in MT-ATP6 gene and the presence of a known homozygous splice site mutation c.516-517delAG in sibling patients added to the presence of a novel double het mutations in LS patient ( c.752-18 A > C/c . 
MT-ATP6_29481804_4	LOF	The result of mutational analysis revealed the absence of mitochondrial mutations in MT-ATP6 gene and the presence of a known homozygous splice site mutation c.516-517delAG in sibling patients added to the presence of a novel double het mutations in LS patient ( c.752-18 A > C/ c.751+16G > A ) . 
PKD1_29887830_1	LOF	Direct sequencing of the index patient revealed a single novel heterozygous frameshift mutation in PKD1 , and lack of mutations in genes usually related to CCM . 
GJC2_23143715_1	LOF	The patients had a novel canonical splicing GJC2 c.-20+1G > C mutation with a predicted loss of the coding connexin 47 protein .
